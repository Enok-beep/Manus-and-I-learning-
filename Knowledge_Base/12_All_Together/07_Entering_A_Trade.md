# Lesson 7: Entering a Trade - The Final Lesson

This lesson (12:52) is the **final lesson** of the entire course, clarifying the different methods for entering a trade.

## Core Concept: Entry Methods

From the transcript:
> "All right, we're gonna make a quick video on clarifying how to enter a trade. Okay? So there's obviously a few different ways that you can enter a trade."

> "Guys, there's a few different ways that you can enter a trade using what I preach here, okay? There's the more dangerous methods. There's medium risk methods,"

> "we'll call it, sorry, high risk method. A medium risk method, and a lower risk method. So quite clearly, you know,"

> "you have to make that decision for yourself on,"

## The Three Entry Methods

### Method 1: High Risk Entry
- **Description**: Entering at the POI without LTF confirmation.
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Reward Potential**: HIGHEST
- **When to Use**: When you have extreme confidence in the HTF setup.

### Method 2: Medium Risk Entry
- **Description**: Entering after initial LTF reaction at the POI.
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- **Reward Potential**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- **When to Use**: When you want a balance between risk and reward.

### Method 3: Low Risk Entry
- **Description**: Entering after full LTF BOS confirmation.
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Reward Potential**: LOWER (due to later entry)
- **When to Use**: When you want maximum confirmation.

## The Risk/Reward Trade-Off

| Entry Method | Risk | Reward | Stop Distance | Win Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| High Risk | HIGH | HIGHEST | Tight | Lower |
| Medium Risk | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Medium | Medium |
| Low Risk | LOW | LOWER | Wider | Higher |

### The Key Insight:
> "you have to make that decision for yourself on,"

This is a personal choice based on:
- Your risk tolerance.
- Your confidence in the setup.
- Your trading style.

## Visual Reference: "Clarifying How to Enter a Trade"

The video shows a diagram with:
1. **Supply Zone** at the top.
2. **Price approaching** the supply zone.
3. **Re-Confirming = Enter on BOS Close** annotation.

### The "Re-Confirming" Concept:
- This is the **Low Risk** method.
- Wait for the LTF to confirm the reversal.
- Enter on the BOS close (body close, not wick).

## Connection to Previous Lessons

### From Risk Management (Chapter 2):
- **Position Sizing** remains constant regardless of entry method.
- **Stop Loss** placement changes based on entry method.
- **Risk per trade** should always be the same (1-2%).

### From Market Structure (Chapter 3):
- **BOS Confirmation** is the "Low Risk" entry trigger.
- **Body Close** is required for a valid BOS.
- **Wick Breaks** are not confirmation.

### From Supply and Demand (Chapter 4):
- **POI** is where you look for entries.
- **Zone Reaction** is the first sign of interest.
- **Zone Confirmation** is the full reversal signal.

### From Orderflow (Chapter 5):
- **RIMC Cycle** determines the entry timing.
- **Mitigation** is the touch of the POI.
- **Continuation** is the move away from the POI.

## The Decision Framework

### Before Entering:
1. **Assess your confidence** in the HTF setup.
2. **Choose your entry method** based on confidence.
3. **Calculate your position size** based on stop distance.
4. **Execute the trade** when the conditions are met.

### The Professional Approach:
> **There is no "best" entry method.**
> - High risk entries can be profitable with high confidence setups.
> - Low risk entries can be profitable with consistent execution.
> - The key is to match your entry method to your trading style.

## The "Grand Secret" - Complete Synthesis

### The Complete Trading System:
1. **Risk Management** – How much to risk.
2. **Market Structure** – Which direction to trade.
3. **Supply and Demand** – Where to look for entries.
4. **Orderflow** – When to enter (RIMC cycle).
5. **Advanced Market Structure** – How to use multiple timeframes.
6. **Liquidity** – Why price moves to certain levels.
7. **Ranges** – The boundaries of the battlefield.
8. **Wyckoff** – The blueprint for accumulation/distribution.
9. **Advanced Range Techniques** – The execution model for range trading.
10. **Strategies** – The specific setups (Phoenix Deviation, S2D/D2S Flips).
11. **All Together** – The complete trade lifecycle.

### The Final Interconnection:
> **Everything connects to everything.**
> - Risk Management protects you.
> - Market Structure guides you.
> - Supply and Demand locates you.
> - Orderflow times you.
> - Liquidity explains you.
> - Ranges bounds you.
> - Wyckoff patterns you.
> - Strategies executes you.
> - Trade Management optimizes you.

### The Ultimate Rule:
> **Trade with the HTF bias, enter at the POI, confirm on the LTF, manage with structure.**

## Summary

This final lesson clarifies the different methods for entering a trade, emphasizing that the choice between high, medium, and low risk entries is a personal decision based on confidence and trading style.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Three entry methods exist** – High, Medium, and Low risk.
2. **Risk and reward are inversely related** – Higher risk = higher potential reward.
3. **The choice is personal** – Match your entry to your style.
4. **Confirmation is key** – BOS close is the safest entry trigger.
