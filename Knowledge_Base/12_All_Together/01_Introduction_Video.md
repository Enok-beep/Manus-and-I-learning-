# Lesson 1: Introduction Video - Putting It All Together

This lesson (01:32) is a brief introduction to the **"All Together"** series, which demonstrates how to apply all the concepts learned throughout the course in a step-by-step trade analysis.

## Core Concept: The Integration Series

From the transcript:
> "Alright guys, this is the Altogether series. This is a very brief introduction video. My goal for this series is to lay out a bunch of trades."

> "We're gonna update it over time. We're gonna throw some trades out there. Each trade will have a few different videos."

> "I'm gonna try to make it a longer process, okay? So you can see exactly what's going on in my mind, when I'm planning,"

> "when I'm thinking of that trade, when I'm trying to figure out a trade, when I'm trying to execute that trade, I'm trying to take profit on that trade."

## Purpose of This Series

### What You Will Learn:
1. **How to plan a trade** – The thought process before entry.
2. **How to figure out a trade** – Identifying the setup.
3. **How to execute a trade** – The actual entry.
4. **How to take profit** – Managing the trade to completion.

### The "Longer Process" Approach:
> Jayson intentionally breaks down each trade into multiple videos.
> - This allows you to see the **real-time decision-making**.
> - It shows the **patience required** for high-quality setups.
> - It demonstrates the **integration of all concepts**.

## Structure of the Series

### Each Trade Will Include:
| Step | Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Step 1** | HTF Analysis (Market Structure, Bias) |
| **Step 2** | POI Identification (S&D Zones, Liquidity) |
| **Step 3** | LTF Confirmation (Orderflow, Entry Model) |
| **Step 4** | Trade Execution (Entry, Stop Loss) |
| **Step 5** | Trade Management (De-Risking, Targets) |

### Why Multiple Videos Per Trade:
> "Each trade will have a few different videos."
> - This mirrors the **real trading experience**.
> - It shows that trading is a **process**, not a single decision.
> - It reinforces the **patience and discipline** required.

## Connection to the "Grand Secret"

### The Ultimate Integration:
> This series is the **culmination** of everything you've learned.
> - Risk Management → Position sizing and stop loss.
> - Market Structure → Direction and bias.
> - Supply and Demand → Entry zones.
> - Orderflow → Entry timing.
> - Liquidity → Targets and magnets.
> - Ranges → Context and boundaries.
> - Wyckoff → Accumulation/Distribution patterns.
> - Strategies → Specific setups.

### The Key Insight:
> **Trading is not about one concept; it's about the integration of all concepts.**
> - Each concept is a "layer" of the analysis.
> - The more layers that align, the higher the probability.
> - The "All Together" series shows this integration in action.

## What to Expect

### From the Transcript:
> "My goal for this series is to lay out a bunch of trades."
> - Multiple trades will be analyzed.
> - Each trade will be broken down step-by-step.
> - You will see the **complete process** from planning to profit.

### The Learning Objective:
> **To internalize the complete trading process.**
> - Not just the "what" but the "how" and "why."
> - To see the concepts applied in real-time.
> - To build the "muscle memory" for your own trading.

## Summary

This introduction sets the stage for the "All Together" series, which will demonstrate the complete integration of all course concepts through step-by-step trade analyses.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **This is the integration series** – All concepts come together.
2. **Each trade has multiple videos** – To show the complete process.
3. **Focus on the thought process** – Not just the outcome.
4. **This is how professionals trade** – Methodical and patient.
