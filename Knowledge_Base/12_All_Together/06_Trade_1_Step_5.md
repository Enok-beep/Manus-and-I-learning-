# Lesson 6: Trade 1 Step 5 - Trade Management (Ethereum Example)

This lesson (15:18) demonstrates the **fifth and final step** of a complete trade analysis: managing the trade after entry.

## Core Concept: From Entry to Exit

From the transcript:
> "So now we're talking about step five because we have the range break, because we have the, the structural change that exists."

> "Now we can start changing our targets and our take profit levels. We can start looking at them, right? So quite clearly the next high is weak."

> "So that's where I'm gonna extend my target to. We can't really make an assumption that this is going to break 'cause we don't"

> "know if it's going to break. In theory, all we know is that it's weak in nature and it should be touched."

### Step 5: Trade Management Framework

This lesson focuses on the **fifth step** of the trading process:

| Step | Focus | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Step 1 | HTF Analysis | ✅ Complete |
| Step 2 | POI Identification | ✅ Complete |
| Step 3 | LTF Confirmation | ✅ Complete |
| Step 4 | Trade Execution | ✅ Complete |
| **Step 5** | **Trade Management** | **Current** |

### Key Insight: Dynamic Target Adjustment

From the transcript:
> "Now we can start changing our targets and our take profit levels."

This is the professional approach:
- **Targets are not static.**
- **Adjust based on new information.**
- **Follow the structure as it develops.**

## The Trade Management Process

### After Entry:
1. **Monitor the structural development** on the LTF.
2. **Identify new weak/strong points** as they form.
3. **Adjust targets** based on the new information.
4. **Move stop loss** to protect profits.

### The "Weak High" Concept
From the transcript:
> "So quite clearly the next high is weak."
> "In theory, all we know is that it's weak in nature and it should be touched."

This connects back to **Protected vs. Targeted** (Chapter 3):
- A **Weak High** is a target—price should touch it.
- A **Strong High** is a barrier—price may not break it.
- Use weak points as take-profit levels.

## Target Extension Strategy

### From the Transcript:
> "So that's where I'm gonna extend my target to."

The target extension process:
1. **Initial Target**: Set based on the original analysis.
2. **Extended Target**: Adjust when structure confirms continuation.
3. **Final Target**: The ultimate destination (HTF target).

### The "Should Be Touched" Rule:
> "all we know is that it's weak in nature and it should be touched."

This is a key distinction:
- **"Should be touched"** = high probability target.
- **"Should break"** = uncertain, requires confirmation.
- Don't assume a break; wait for confirmation.

## The Assumption Trap

### From the Transcript:
> "We can't really make an assumption that this is going to break 'cause we don't know if it's going to break."

This is a critical mindset insight:
- **Don't assume continuation.**
- **Take profits at logical levels.**
- **Let the market prove itself.**

### The Professional Approach:
1. **Take partial profits** at the first target.
2. **Move stop to break even** after TP1.
3. **Let the rest run** to the extended target.
4. **Exit if structure breaks** against you.

## Connection to the "Grand Secret"

### The Complete Trade Lifecycle:
> **HTF → POI → LTF → Scenarios → Execution → Management**
> - HTF provides the **direction**.
> - POI provides the **area**.
> - LTF provides the **trigger**.
> - Scenarios provide the **plan**.
> - Execution is the **action**.
> - Management is the **optimization**.

### Why Trade Management Matters:
> If you don't manage the trade, you will:
> - Leave money on the table.
> - Get stopped out prematurely.
> - Miss the big moves.

### The Professional Approach:
> **The entry is just the beginning.**
> - The real skill is in the management.
> - This is where you maximize profits.
> - This is where you protect your capital.

## Connection to Risk Management (Chapter 2)

### The De-Risking Process:
1. **TP1**: Take partial profits (pay for your risk).
2. **Move SL to BE**: Eliminate the risk.
3. **TP2**: Take more profits (build your wealth).
4. **Trail SL**: Protect the remaining position.

### The Compounding Effect:
> By managing trades properly, you:
> - Lock in profits consistently.
> - Reduce drawdowns.
> - Allow compounding to work.

## Summary

This lesson demonstrates the fifth and final step of a complete trade analysis: managing the trade after entry using Ethereum as an example.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Targets are dynamic** – Adjust based on new information.
2. **Weak points are targets** – They should be touched.
3. **Don't assume breaks** – Wait for confirmation.
4. **Manage the trade actively** – This is where the real skill is.
