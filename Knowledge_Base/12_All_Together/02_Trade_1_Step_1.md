# Lesson 2: Trade 1 Step 1 - HTF Analysis (Ethereum Example)

This lesson (18:13) demonstrates the **first step** of a complete trade analysis: establishing the Higher Timeframe (HTF) context and bias.

## Core Concept: The Complete Process

From the transcript:
> "All right, so this series is going to be specifically about running through trades using everything that we've learned in this course."

> "So obviously this is something that you'd wanna wait to watch until you've completed the entire course. We're going to run through E in this example."

> "And as time progresses I will run through other series of trades. Okay? We'll just make this, we'll call this trade one right upon initial release there will be trade one."

## The Trade Setup: Ethereum (ETH)

### Step 1: HTF Analysis Framework

This lesson focuses on the **first step** of the trading process:

| Step | Focus | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Step 1** | HTF Analysis | Establish bias and context |
| Step 2 | POI Identification | Find entry zones |
| Step 3 | LTF Confirmation | Wait for entry signal |
| Step 4 | Trade Execution | Enter the trade |
| Step 5 | Trade Management | Manage to profit |

### What to Look For in HTF Analysis:

1. **Market Structure** – Is the market bullish, bearish, or ranging?
2. **Swing Points** – Where are the key highs and lows?
3. **Protected vs. Targeted Levels** – Which levels are "safe" and which are "targets"?
4. **Liquidity** – Where is the liquidity resting?
5. **Supply/Demand Zones** – Where are the key POIs?

## The Integration Process

### From the Transcript:
> "And then of course over time I will be adding into..."

This series will progressively add more trades, showing the same process applied to different market conditions.

### The Key Insight:
> **The HTF analysis is the foundation of every trade.**
> - Without HTF context, you are trading blind.
> - The HTF tells you the "story" of the market.
> - All LTF entries must align with the HTF narrative.

## Applying the Course Concepts

### Market Structure (Chapter 3):
- Identify the current trend (HH/HL or LH/LL).
- Find the most recent BOS.
- Determine if the structure is bullish or bearish.

### Supply and Demand (Chapter 4):
- Mark the key S&D zones on the HTF.
- Identify which zones have caused a BOS.
- Note which zones are "fresh" (unmitigated).

### Liquidity (Chapter 7):
- Mark the obvious liquidity pools (equal highs/lows).
- Identify trendline liquidity.
- Note which liquidity has been swept.

### Ranges (Chapter 8):
- Is the market in a range?
- If so, where is the premium/discount?
- What is the range high/low?

## The "All Together" Framework

### Step 1 Checklist:
1. ☐ Open the HTF chart (4H, Daily, Weekly).
2. ☐ Identify the current market structure.
3. ☐ Mark the key swing highs and lows.
4. ☐ Identify protected vs. targeted levels.
5. ☐ Mark the key S&D zones.
6. ☐ Identify the liquidity pools.
7. ☐ Determine the overall bias.

### The Outcome of Step 1:
> **A clear understanding of the HTF context.**
> - You know the direction (bullish/bearish).
> - You know the key levels (S&D, liquidity).
> - You know what you're looking for on the LTF.

## Connection to the "Grand Secret"

### The Hierarchy of Analysis:
> **HTF → MTF → LTF**
> - HTF provides the **context**.
> - MTF provides the **confirmation**.
> - LTF provides the **entry**.

### Why This Order Matters:
> If you skip the HTF analysis, you will:
> - Trade against the trend.
> - Enter at the wrong zones.
> - Get stopped out by liquidity grabs.

### The Professional Approach:
> **Always start with the HTF.**
> - This is how institutions trade.
> - This is how you avoid "noise."
> - This is how you find high-probability setups.

## Summary

This lesson demonstrates the first step of a complete trade analysis: establishing the HTF context and bias using Ethereum as an example.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **HTF analysis is the foundation** – Always start here.
2. **Use all the concepts** – Structure, S&D, Liquidity, Ranges.
3. **Establish the bias** – Know the direction before looking for entries.
4. **Mark the key levels** – S&D zones, liquidity pools, swing points.
