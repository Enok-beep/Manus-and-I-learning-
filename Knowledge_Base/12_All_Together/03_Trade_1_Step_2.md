# Lesson 3: Trade 1 Step 2 - POI Identification (Ethereum Example)

This lesson (10:37) demonstrates the **second step** of a complete trade analysis: identifying the Points of Interest (POI) for potential entries.

## Core Concept: From HTF Context to Entry Zones

From the transcript:
> "So we know with step one we were able to figure out a high timeframe, P O I a high timeframe market structure idea."

> "We actually have two different interest zones. We had area one and then area two. Now at this point, you know what."

> "they're separated by a very tiny amount of space here, we'll call it empty space. We usually wanna have a situation like this."

> "I generally just combine them, like realistically it doesn't matter to me. Even if it bounces in that weight zone right there. Really it doesn't."

### Step 2: POI Identification Framework

This lesson focuses on the **second step** of the trading process:

| Step | Focus | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Step 1 | HTF Analysis | ✅ Complete |
| **Step 2** | **POI Identification** | **Current** |
| Step 3 | LTF Confirmation | Next |
| Step 4 | Trade Execution | Pending |
| Step 5 | Trade Management | Pending |

### Key Insight: Combining Zones

From the transcript:
> "I generally just combine them, like realistically it doesn't matter to me."

This is a critical practical insight:
- When two zones are very close together, **combine them**.
- Don't overthink the "exact" entry point.
- The **zone** is more important than the **line**.

## The POI Selection Process

### From HTF Analysis (Step 1):
1. We identified the market structure (bullish/bearish).
2. We marked the key swing points.
3. We identified the overall bias.

### In POI Identification (Step 2):
1. **Find the S&D zones** that align with the HTF bias.
2. **Evaluate the zones** using the criteria from Chapter 4.
3. **Combine overlapping zones** for simplicity.
4. **Mark the final POI** for entry.

## Zone Evaluation Criteria

### From Chapter 4 (Supply and Demand):
1. **Freshness** – Has the zone been tested before?
2. **Strength** – Did the zone cause a BOS?
3. **Type** – Is it a reversal or continuation zone?
4. **Confluence** – Does it align with other factors?

### The "Empty Space" Concept:
> "they're separated by a very tiny amount of space here, we'll call it empty space."

When zones are separated by "empty space":
- The market may bounce between them.
- Combining them simplifies the analysis.
- The combined zone becomes a "super POI."

## Practical Application

### The Two-Zone Scenario:
1. **Zone 1**: First area of interest.
2. **Zone 2**: Second area of interest.
3. **Empty Space**: Small gap between zones.
4. **Solution**: Combine into one larger zone.

### Why This Works:
> "Even if it bounces in that weight zone right there. Really it doesn't."

- The exact entry point is less important than being in the right area.
- Combining zones reduces the risk of "missing" the entry.
- It simplifies the decision-making process.

## Connection to the "Grand Secret"

### The Hierarchy of Precision:
> **HTF → POI → LTF**
> - HTF provides the **direction**.
> - POI provides the **area**.
> - LTF provides the **trigger**.

### Why POI Selection Matters:
> If you select the wrong POI, you will:
> - Enter against the trend.
> - Get stopped out by liquidity grabs.
> - Miss the high-probability setups.

### The Professional Approach:
> **Use the HTF to find the POI.**
> - Don't look for entries on the LTF without a POI.
> - The POI is your "hunting ground."
> - All LTF analysis happens within the POI.

## Summary

This lesson demonstrates the second step of a complete trade analysis: identifying the Points of Interest (POI) for potential entries using Ethereum as an example.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **POI comes from HTF analysis** – Use the zones from Step 1.
2. **Combine close zones** – Don't overthink the exact entry.
3. **The zone is more important than the line** – Focus on the area.
4. **Simplify the process** – Fewer zones = clearer decisions.
