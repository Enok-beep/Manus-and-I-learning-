# Lesson 13: Breaker Blocks

This lesson explains the concept of **Breaker Blocks**, which are a specific type of order block that forms when a previous zone *fails* and is then "broken" by price.

## What is a Breaker Block?

A **Breaker Block** is an order block that was previously a Supply zone but has now become a Demand zone (or vice versa). It is created when price breaks through a zone, invalidating it, and then returns to use that same zone as support or resistance in the opposite direction.

### The Simple Definition

The easiest way to understand a Breaker Block is this: **A failed Supply zone becomes a Demand zone, and a failed Demand zone becomes a Supply zone.**

### How Breaker Blocks Form

1. **Original Zone**: A Supply or Demand zone is created.
2. **Zone Failure**: Price breaks through the zone with a strong, impulsive move (a BOS).
3. **Polarity Flip**: The zone "flips" its polarity. What was once resistance is now support, and vice versa.
4. **Breaker Entry**: Price returns to the "broken" zone, and you enter in the *new* direction.

## The "Grand Secret" of Breaker Blocks

The interconnection here is between **Zone Failure and Opportunity**:
- **Failure is Not the End**: When a zone fails, it is not a loss; it is a *new opportunity*.
- **The Polarity Flip**: The concept of "polarity flip" is one of the most powerful in trading. It explains why old support becomes new resistance and vice versa.
- **The Solution**: When a zone you were watching fails, do not despair. Mark it as a potential Breaker Block and wait for price to return. This connects back to **Market Structure** (Lesson 3.03 - BOS): a Breaker Block is always created by a BOS. The BOS invalidates the old zone and creates the new Breaker.
