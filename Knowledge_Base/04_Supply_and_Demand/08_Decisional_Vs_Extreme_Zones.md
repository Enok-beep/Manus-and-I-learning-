# Lesson 8: Decisional Vs Extreme Point Zones

This lesson clarifies the critical distinction between **Decisional Point (DP)** zones and **Extreme Point** zones, which is fundamental for selecting high-probability Points of Interest.

## Understanding the Two Zone Types

### 1. Extreme Point Zones
An **Extreme Point** zone is located at the very edge of a price range. It represents the absolute high or low of a move.

| Characteristic | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | At the tip of a swing high or swing low. |
| **Function** | This is where the trend *originated* or *reversed*. |
| **Probability** | Higher probability of a strong reaction because it represents the "last line of defense" for the trend. |
| **Use Case** | Best for catching reversals or trading from the extreme of a HTF range. |

### 2. Decisional Point (DP) Zones
A **Decisional Point** zone is located *within* a price range, not at the extreme. It represents a point where the market "decided" to continue the trend.

| Characteristic | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | Within the body of a move, often at a BOS or continuation point. |
| **Function** | This is where the trend was *confirmed* or *continued*. |
| **Probability** | Lower probability than Extreme zones, as they can be "swept" by price hunting for liquidity. |
| **Use Case** | Best for adding to an existing position or for quick scalps within a trend. |

## The "Grand Secret" of DP vs. Extreme

The interconnection here is between **Zone Location and Trade Expectation**:
- **Extreme Zones** are for "Home Run" trades. You expect a major reversal or a strong bounce.
- **Decisional Zones** are for "Base Hit" trades. You expect a reaction, but you should be prepared for the zone to fail.
- **The Solution**: Prioritize **Extreme Zones** for your primary entries. Use **Decisional Zones** only when they are backed by strong confluence (e.g., a HTF FVG or a Liquidity Sweep). This connects back to **Market Structure** (Lesson 3.10): an Extreme zone is always a **Protected** level, while a Decisional zone is often a **Targeted** level.
