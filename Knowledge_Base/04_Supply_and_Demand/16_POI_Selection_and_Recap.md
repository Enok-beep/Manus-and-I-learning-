# Lesson 16: POI Selection and Recap

This lesson is the **culmination of the Supply and Demand chapter**. It provides a complete framework for selecting your **Point of Interest (POI)** and recaps all the key concepts learned.

## What is a POI?

A **Point of Interest (POI)** is the specific price zone where you are looking for an entry. It is the area on your chart where you expect price to react. A POI is not just any S&D zone; it is the *best* S&D zone for the current market context.

## The POI Selection Framework

### Step 1: Determine the HTF Bias
Before looking for a POI, you must know the direction of the market. Use the **Market Structure** rules (Chapter 3) to determine if you should be looking for Longs or Shorts.

### Step 2: Identify HTF POIs
Mark the major S&D zones on the Higher Timeframe (e.g., 4H, Daily). These are your "areas of interest."

### Step 3: Refine with LTF Structure
Once price enters an HTF POI, drop down to the Lower Timeframe (e.g., 15m, 5m) and look for a **CHoCH** (Change of Character) to confirm that the zone is holding.

### Step 4: Find the LTF POI
Within the LTF CHoCH, identify the specific order block that caused the shift. This is your **LTF POI**—your precise entry point.

### Step 5: Validate with Confluence
Apply the "Best Criteria" checklist:
- [ ] Liquidity Sweep?
- [ ] Fair Value Gap (FVG)?
- [ ] BOS Causation?
- [ ] Volume Confluence?
- [ ] Unmitigated?

## The "Ultimate Interconnection" of Supply and Demand

This chapter has taught us that **S&D zones are the "Where" of trading**. They tell us where to look for entries. But they are not standalone concepts. They are deeply interconnected with everything else:

| Concept | Connection to S&D |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Management** | S&D zones define your stop loss (below/above the zone) and your targets (the next opposing zone). |
| **Market Structure** | S&D zones are *created* by structural moves (BOS). The strongest zones are those that *cause* a BOS. |
| **Liquidity** | S&D zones are often located at liquidity pools. A sweep of liquidity *into* a zone is a high-confluence entry signal. |
| **FVGs** | An FVG within an S&D zone is a "magnet" that pulls price back to the zone. |

**The Grand Secret of Supply and Demand**: The market is a constant battle between buyers and sellers. S&D zones are the "battlefields" where these battles are fought. By identifying the strongest battlefields (high-confluence zones), you can position yourself on the winning side of the war.
