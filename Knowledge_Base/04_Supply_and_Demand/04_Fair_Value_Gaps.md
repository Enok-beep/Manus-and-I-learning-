# Lesson 4: Inefficient/Efficient Price Action (Fair Value Gaps)

This lesson explores the concept of market efficiency and the role of **Fair Value Gaps (FVG)** as the "magnet" that drives price movement.

## Understanding Price Efficiency

### 1. Efficient Price Action
- **Definition**: Price action where every price level has been "offered" to both buyers and sellers.
- **Visual**: Overlapping candle wicks and bodies that leave no gaps.
- **Significance**: Efficient price action shows a balanced market where orders are being filled smoothly.

### 2. Inefficient Price Action (Fair Value Gaps)
- **Definition**: A three-candle pattern where there is a gap between the wick of the first candle and the wick of the third candle.
- **Visual**: A large, impulsive middle candle that "leaps" over price levels without giving the other side a chance to trade.
- **Significance**: An FVG represents an imbalance that the market "wants" to fill (rebalance) in the future.

## The "Grand Secret" of FVGs

The interconnection here is between **FVGs and S&D Zones**:
- **The Magnet**: An FVG acts as a magnet, pulling price back toward the **S&D Zone** that created the imbalance.
- **The Validation**: A high-quality S&D zone **must** have an FVG immediately following it. If there is no FVG, the move was not impulsive enough to leave institutional orders behind.
- **The Solution**: Use FVGs to filter your S&D zones. If a zone has already been "filled" (price has returned and closed the gap), the zone is less likely to hold. If the FVG is still "open," the zone is a high-probability POI. This connects back to **Market Structure** (Lesson 3.10): price will often "sweep" internal structure to fill an FVG before continuing the HTF trend.
