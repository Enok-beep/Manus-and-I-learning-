# Lesson 11: Liquidity/Sweep Zones

This lesson explains how **Liquidity Sweeps** enhance the quality of an order block (S&D zone) and why they are a critical filter for high-probability trades.

## What Makes an Order Block Stronger?

The answer is **Liquidity**. When defining a pivot-created order block (a refined S&D zone), the ideal scenario is to find one that has "purged" or "swept" liquidity in some way.

### The Concept of Liquidity Purging

A **Liquidity Sweep** occurs when price takes out a previous high or low (where stop losses are resting) before reversing. This action "purges" the liquidity from the market.

| Scenario | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sweep High** | Price briefly breaks above a previous high, triggering buy stops, then reverses sharply downward. |
| **Sweep Low** | Price briefly breaks below a previous low, triggering sell stops, then reverses sharply upward. |

### Why Sweeps Strengthen Zones

If an order block is created *after* a liquidity sweep, it is significantly stronger than one created without a sweep. The reason is simple: the "fuel" has been collected. The market has grabbed the stop losses, and now it has the liquidity to move in the opposite direction.

## The "Grand Secret" of Liquidity/Sweep Zones

The interconnection here is between **Liquidity and Zone Reliability**:
- **The Sweep is the "Fuel"**: A zone that forms after a sweep has the "fuel" to move aggressively.
- **The Solution**: When selecting a POI, always ask: "Has this zone swept liquidity?" If the answer is yes, the zone is high-probability. If the answer is no, the zone is still valid, but you should be more cautious and consider taking profits earlier. This connects back to **Market Structure** (Lesson 3.07): a liquidity sweep often creates a **Swing Failure Pattern (SFP)**, which is a powerful reversal signal.
