# Lesson 10: Inducement Example

This lesson provides a practical, chart-based example of how **Inducement** works in real-time trading scenarios.

## The Example Walkthrough

### Scenario Setup
The example shows a bearish internal structure shift. After a BOS to the downside, price begins to pull back. The question is: where will the pullback end?

### Identifying the Inducement
1. **Look for the POI**: Identify the order blocks (S&D zones) that could be potential entry points for a short trade.
2. **Spot the Inducement**: Notice the small, minor high that forms *in front of* the main Supply zone. This is the inducement.
3. **Wait for the Sweep**: Instead of entering at the first touch of the Supply zone, wait for price to sweep the inducement (take out the minor high).

### The Execution
Once the inducement is swept, the "trap" has been sprung. Retail traders who went long at the minor high are now stopped out, and their stop losses provide the liquidity for institutions to enter their short positions. This is the optimal entry point.

## The "Grand Secret" of the Inducement Example

The interconnection here is between **Patience and Precision**:
- **The Trap is the Confirmation**: The sweep of the inducement is not just a "nice to have"; it is a **confirmation signal** that the zone is active.
- **The Solution**: Build the habit of always looking for inducement before entering a zone. If there is no inducement, the trade is still valid, but the probability is slightly lower. If there is inducement and it gets swept, you have a high-probability, high-RR entry. This connects back to **Risk Management**: by waiting for the sweep, you are often entering at a better price, which means a tighter stop loss and a higher Risk/Reward ratio.
