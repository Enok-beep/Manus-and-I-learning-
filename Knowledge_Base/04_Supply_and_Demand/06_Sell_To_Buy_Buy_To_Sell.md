# Lesson 6: Sell To Buy / Buy To Sell (S2B / B2S)

This lesson introduces the concept of **Fractal Demand and Supply** creation through the **Sell To Buy (S2B)** and **Buy To Sell (B2S)** patterns.

## Understanding S2B and B2S

### 1. Sell To Buy (S2B)
- **Definition**: A pattern where institutions aggressively sell (pushing price down) in order to accumulate a larger long position at a lower price.
- **Visual**: A sharp move down that creates a Demand zone, followed by an impulsive move up.
- **The "Why"**: Institutions need liquidity to fill large orders. By selling first, they trigger retail stop losses and create a pool of sellers. They then buy from those sellers at a discount.

### 2. Buy To Sell (B2S)
- **Definition**: A pattern where institutions aggressively buy (pushing price up) in order to distribute a larger short position at a higher price.
- **Visual**: A sharp move up that creates a Supply zone, followed by an impulsive move down.
- **The "Why"**: By buying first, they trigger retail FOMO and create a pool of buyers. They then sell to those buyers at a premium.

## The "Grand Secret" of S2B/B2S

The interconnection here is between **Aggression and Zone Quality**:
- **The More Aggressive, The Better**: The sharper and more violent the initial move (the "Sell" in S2B or the "Buy" in B2S), the higher the quality of the resulting zone.
- **The Solution**: Use the *aggression* of the move as a filter for zone quality. A lazy, grinding move does not leave significant orders behind. A violent, impulsive move does. This connects back to **Fair Value Gaps** (Lesson 4.04): an aggressive S2B or B2S move will almost always create an FVG, which confirms the institutional intent.
