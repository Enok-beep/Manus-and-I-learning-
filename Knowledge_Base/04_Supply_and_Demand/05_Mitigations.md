# Lesson 5: Mitigations

This lesson explains the process of **Mitigation**, which is when price returns to a Supply or Demand zone to "clear" the remaining orders.

## What is Mitigation?

### 1. The Definition
- **Mitigation** occurs when price taps into a previously unmitigated (fresh) S&D zone.
- Institutional traders often cannot fill their entire position in one move. They leave "limit orders" at the origin of the move. Mitigation is the market returning to fill those orders.

### 2. Fresh vs. Mitigated Zones
- **Fresh (Unmitigated) Zone**: A zone that price has not yet returned to. These have the highest probability of a strong reaction.
- **Mitigated Zone**: A zone that price has already tapped into. Each subsequent tap reduces the probability of the zone holding, as the orders are being "consumed."

## The "Grand Secret" of Mitigations

The interconnection here is between **Mitigation and Orderflow**:
- **The Chain**: Mitigations often happen in a "chain." A new S&D zone is created, it is mitigated, and that mitigation creates *another* S&D zone.
- **The Solution**: Always look for the **"Open" (Unmitigated) Zone**. If price is returning to a zone that has already been mitigated 3 times, it is likely a **Liquidity Grab** (Lesson 6.01) rather than a valid entry. This connects back to **Market Structure** (Lesson 3.12): a healthy "Staircase" is essentially a chain of successful mitigations. When a mitigation fails, the staircase breaks.
