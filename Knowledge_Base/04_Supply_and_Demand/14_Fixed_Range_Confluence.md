# Lesson 14: Fixed Range Confluence

This lesson introduces the **Fixed Range Volume Profile** tool and how to use it to add **confluence** to your S&D zones.

## What is Fixed Range Confluence?

**Fixed Range Volume Profile** is a tool that shows you where the most volume was traded within a specific price range. By overlaying this tool on your S&D zones, you can identify areas of high confluence—where price action analysis and volume analysis agree.

### Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Point of Control (POC)** | The price level with the highest traded volume within the selected range. This is a "magnet" for price. |
| **Value Area High (VAH)** | The upper boundary of the area where ~70% of the volume was traded. |
| **Value Area Low (VAL)** | The lower boundary of the area where ~70% of the volume was traded. |

### How to Use Fixed Ranges

1. **Identify a Range**: Select a sideways range, an uptrend, or a downtrend on your chart.
2. **Apply the Tool**: Use the Fixed Range Volume Profile tool in TradingView to analyze the volume distribution within that range.
3. **Find Confluence**: Look for areas where the **POC, VAH, or VAL** aligns with an existing S&D zone. This alignment creates **confluence**.

## The "Grand Secret" of Fixed Range Confluence

The interconnection here is between **Volume and Price Action**:
- **Volume is the "Truth"**: Price action tells you *what* happened; volume tells you *how much conviction* was behind it.
- **The POC is a Magnet**: Price tends to gravitate towards the POC because it represents "fair value" for that range.
- **The Solution**: When selecting a POI, check if it has volume confluence. A Demand zone that aligns with the VAL of a range is significantly stronger than one that does not. This connects back to **Market Structure** (Lesson 3.09 - Determining Bias): the POC can help you determine the "equilibrium" of a range, which is essential for understanding where the market is likely to go next.
