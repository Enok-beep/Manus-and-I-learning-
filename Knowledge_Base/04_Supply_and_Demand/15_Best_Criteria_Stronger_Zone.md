# Lesson 15: Best Criteria to Validate Stronger Zone

This lesson summarizes the key criteria for identifying **high-probability S&D zones**. It is a synthesis of everything learned in the Supply and Demand chapter.

## The Main Criteria for a Strong Zone

By now, we know how to identify both **Range** and **Pivot** zones, as well as **Fractal** zones (order blocks with imbalance). The question is: how do we validate which zone is the *strongest*?

### The Three Main Things to Look At

There are more than three things, but these are the **core criteria**:

| Criteria | Description | Why It Matters |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Liquidity Sweep** | Did the zone form after a sweep of a previous high/low? | A sweep provides the "fuel" for the move. Zones that form after a sweep have higher conviction. |
| **2. Imbalance (FVG)** | Is there a Fair Value Gap associated with the zone? | An FVG shows that the move was *impulsive* and that there is "unfilled" business for price to return to. |
| **3. BOS Causation** | Did the zone *cause* a Break of Structure? | A zone that causes a BOS is a zone where "Smart Money" placed their orders. It is the origin of the move. |

### Additional Confluence Factors

- **Volume Confluence**: Does the zone align with the POC, VAH, or VAL of a Fixed Range Volume Profile?
- **HTF Alignment**: Is the zone in the direction of the HTF bias?
- **Unmitigated**: Has the zone been tested before? A "fresh" zone is stronger than one that has already been mitigated.

## The "Grand Secret" of Zone Validation

The interconnection here is between **Confluence and Probability**:
- **More Confluence = Higher Probability**: A zone that has a liquidity sweep, an FVG, and caused a BOS is a "Triple A" zone. It is the highest probability entry you can find.
- **The Solution**: Create a mental (or physical) checklist. Before entering a trade, ask yourself: "Does this zone have a sweep? Does it have an FVG? Did it cause a BOS?" The more "yes" answers you get, the more confident you should be. This connects back to **Risk Management**: a high-confluence zone allows you to be more aggressive with your position size (within your risk parameters) because the probability of success is higher.
