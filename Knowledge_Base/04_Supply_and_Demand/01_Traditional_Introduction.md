# Lesson 1: Traditional Supply/Demand Introduction

This lesson introduces the core concepts of Supply and Demand (S&D) and how they differ from traditional support and resistance.

## What is Supply and Demand?

### 1. The Definition
- **Supply Zone**: An area on the chart where sellers are more aggressive than buyers, causing price to drop rapidly.
- **Demand Zone**: An area on the chart where buyers are more aggressive than sellers, causing price to rise rapidly.

### 2. The Difference from Support/Resistance
- Support and Resistance are often seen as "lines" where price bounces.
- Supply and Demand are **zones** or **areas of interest (POIs)** where large institutional orders (Smart Money) were placed, leaving an imbalance in the market.

## Identifying a Valid Zone

Jayson Casper outlines the basic criteria for a valid S&D zone:
1.  **The Impulse**: Price must leave the zone with a strong, aggressive move (large candles).
2.  **The Imbalance**: The move must create an imbalance (Fair Value Gap) that shows the market was one-sided.
3.  **The Origin**: The zone is the "last candle" or the "consolidation" before the aggressive move started.

## The "Grand Secret" of Supply and Demand

The interconnection here is between **S&D and Market Structure**:
- A valid S&D zone is often the **origin of a BOS** (Break of Structure).
- The "grand secret" is that S&D zones are the **"Fuel Stations"** of the market. Price moves from one zone to another to pick up orders.
- **The Solution**: Don't just trade every S&D zone you see. Only trade zones that are in alignment with the **HTF Bias** (Lesson 3.09) and have successfully created a **BOS** (Lesson 3.03). This connects back to **Risk Management**: it ensures you are trading from high-probability areas where the "Smart Money" has already shown their hand.
