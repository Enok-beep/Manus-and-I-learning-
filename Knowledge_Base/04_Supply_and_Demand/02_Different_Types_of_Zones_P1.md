# Lesson 2: Different types of Supply/Demand Zones (Part 1)

This lesson categorizes the different ways Supply and Demand zones form on the chart, moving beyond the basic definition to specific structural patterns.

## The Four Primary S&D Patterns

Jayson Casper identifies four main ways that institutional orders are clustered:

### 1. Rally-Base-Rally (RBR) - Demand
- **Structure**: Price is moving up, pauses (creates a "base"), and then continues to move up aggressively.
- **The Zone**: The "base" (consolidation) is the Demand zone.
- **Context**: This is a **Continuation** pattern.

### 2. Drop-Base-Drop (DBD) - Supply
- **Structure**: Price is moving down, pauses (creates a "base"), and then continues to move down aggressively.
- **The Zone**: The "base" (consolidation) is the Supply zone.
- **Context**: This is a **Continuation** pattern.

### 3. Drop-Base-Rally (DBR) - Demand
- **Structure**: Price is moving down, pauses (creates a "base"), and then reverses to move up aggressively.
- **The Zone**: The "base" (consolidation) is the Demand zone.
- **Context**: This is a **Reversal** pattern.

### 4. Rally-Base-Drop (RBD) - Supply
- **Structure**: Price is moving up, pauses (creates a "base"), and then reverses to move down aggressively.
- **The Zone**: The "base" (consolidation) is the Supply zone.
- **Context**: This is a **Reversal** pattern.

## The "Grand Secret" of Zone Types

The interconnection here is between **Zone Type and Probability**:
- **Reversal Zones (DBR/RBD)** are often found at the **Extreme** of a HTF Swing Range. They have higher probability because they represent a major shift in institutional intent.
- **Continuation Zones (RBR/DBD)** are often found as **Decisional** levels within a trend. They are useful for adding to positions but are more likely to be "swept" if the HTF trend is exhausted.
- **The Solution**: Always identify if your zone is a Reversal or Continuation pattern. This connects back to **Market Structure** (Lesson 3.04): a Reversal S&D zone is the "engine" behind a **CHoCH** (Change of Character), while a Continuation S&D zone is the "engine" behind a **BOS** (Break of Structure).
