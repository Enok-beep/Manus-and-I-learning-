# Lesson 7: Analysis (Structural Walkthroughs)

This lesson is a practical, chart-based walkthrough showing how to combine **Market Structure** and **Supply/Demand** concepts to perform a complete analysis.

## The Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Identify the HTF Market Structure
- Start on a higher timeframe (e.g., Daily or 4H).
- Determine the overall bias: Is the market making Higher Highs and Higher Lows (Bullish) or Lower Highs and Lower Lows (Bearish)?
- Identify the most recent **Protected** and **Targeted** levels.

### Step 2: Mark the Relevant S&D Zones
- On the same HTF, identify the S&D zones that caused the most recent **BOS** (Break of Structure).
- These are your primary **Points of Interest (POIs)**.
- Prioritize **Extreme** zones (at the edge of the range) over **Decisional** zones (within the range).

### Step 3: Drill Down to the LTF for Entry
- Once price approaches your HTF POI, switch to a lower timeframe (e.g., 15m or 5m).
- Wait for a **CHoCH** (Change of Character) or **BOS** on the LTF that confirms the HTF bias.
- Enter from a LTF S&D zone that is created by the LTF structural shift.

## The "Grand Secret" of Analysis

The interconnection here is between **HTF Context and LTF Execution**:
- **The HTF is the "Commander"**: It tells you the direction and the area of interest.
- **The LTF is the "Sniper"**: It gives you the precise entry and stop loss.
- **The Solution**: Never trade the LTF in isolation. Every LTF trade must be a "child" of a HTF setup. This connects back to **Risk Management** (Lesson 2.06): by using the LTF for entry, you can achieve much tighter stop losses, which dramatically improves your Risk/Reward ratio while keeping your dollar risk constant.
