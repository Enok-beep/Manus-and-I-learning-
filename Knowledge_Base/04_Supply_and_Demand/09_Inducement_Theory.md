# Lesson 9: Inducement Theory

This lesson introduces the concept of **Inducement**, which is a technique used to add emphasis and precision to an order block (S&D zone).

## What is Inducement?

**Inducement** is a small structural point (a minor high or low) that forms *in front of* a larger S&D zone. It acts as "bait" that lures retail traders into a losing position before the real move begins.

### How Inducement Works

The market creates a small, obvious level (the inducement) that retail traders will use as their entry or stop loss. When price sweeps this level, it triggers those retail orders, providing liquidity for institutions to fill their larger positions at the main S&D zone behind it.

### When to Use Inducement

Inducement is primarily used with **Pivot Created** zones (refined order blocks), not with **Range Created** zones. The concept is to identify a small "trap" that sits in front of your zone, which increases the probability of your zone holding.

## The "Grand Secret" of Inducement

The interconnection here is between **Inducement and Liquidity**:
- **The Trap**: The inducement is a "trap" set by smart money to catch retail traders.
- **The Confirmation**: When the inducement is "swept" (price takes out the minor high/low and then reverses), it confirms that liquidity has been grabbed and the main zone is now active.
- **The Solution**: Do not enter at the first touch of a zone. Wait for the **inducement to be swept**. This gives you a much higher probability entry because the "fuel" (retail stop losses) has been collected. This connects back to **Risk Management**: by waiting for the sweep, you can often get a better entry price, which improves your Risk/Reward ratio.
