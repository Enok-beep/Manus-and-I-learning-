# Lesson 3: Different Types of Supply/Demand Part 2

This lesson introduces more advanced ways to identify Supply and Demand zones, specifically focusing on **Pivot Created** and **Range Created** zones.

## Advanced Zone Identification

### 1. Pivot Created Zones
- **Definition**: A zone that is created at a sharp turning point (a "pivot") in the market.
- **Characteristics**: These zones often look like a single candle or a small cluster of candles that immediately precede a massive, impulsive move.
- **Significance**: Pivot created zones represent a sudden and aggressive injection of institutional orders.

### 2. Range Created Zones
- **Definition**: A zone that is created after a period of consolidation or "ranging" price action.
- **Characteristics**: These zones are wider and represent a "battle" between buyers and sellers that was eventually won by one side, leading to an impulsive breakout.
- **Significance**: Range created zones show where a large volume of orders was accumulated before the move.

## The "Grand Secret" of Pivot vs. Range

The interconnection here is between **Zone Origin and Entry Precision**:
- **Pivot Created Zones** offer the highest precision. Because the origin is a single point, your stop loss can be much tighter.
- **Range Created Zones** offer higher "strength" but less precision. Because the zone is wider, you often need to wait for a LTF confirmation *within* the range to refine your entry.
- **The Solution**: Use **Pivot Created Zones** for aggressive, high RR entries. Use **Range Created Zones** as major POIs where you expect a reaction, but look for a "Pivot" within that range on a lower timeframe to actually execute the trade. This connects back to **Risk Management** (Lesson 2.02): it allows you to maintain a constant dollar risk while significantly increasing your potential reward by refining your entry point.
