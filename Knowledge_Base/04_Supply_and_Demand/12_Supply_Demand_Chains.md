# Lesson 12: Supply/Demand Chains

This lesson introduces the concept of **S&D Chains**, which explains how zones are connected across different structural levels and how to use this connection to find high-probability entries.

## What are Supply/Demand Chains?

An **S&D Chain** is a sequence of connected order blocks that form as price moves through the market. After a Break of Structure (BOS), it is common to see a **mitigation** (a pullback to an order block) before the next leg of the move. These mitigations create a "chain" of zones.

### The Chain Concept

The concept works from both a **Range-Bound** and a **Fractal (Pivot-Based)** standpoint. The key insight is that after a BOS, the market often returns to mitigate the order block that caused the break. This creates a predictable pattern of entries.

### How Chains Form

1. **Initial Move**: Price makes an impulsive move, creating a BOS.
2. **Mitigation**: Price pulls back to the order block that caused the BOS.
3. **Continuation**: Price reacts from the order block and continues in the direction of the trend.
4. **New Zone**: The reaction creates a *new* order block, which becomes the next link in the chain.

This process repeats, creating a "chain" of zones that you can trade from.

## The "Grand Secret" of S&D Chains

The interconnection here is between **Chains and Trend Following**:
- **The Chain is the Trend**: In a healthy trend, you will see a clear chain of order blocks being created and mitigated.
- **The Break of the Chain**: When a zone in the chain *fails* to hold (price breaks through it), it is a major warning sign that the trend is weakening.
- **The Solution**: Use the chain to identify your entries. Trade from the most recent "link" in the chain. If that link fails, the chain is broken, and you should look for a reversal. This connects back to **Market Structure** (Lesson 3.12 - Staircasing): the S&D Chain is the *reason* behind the staircase pattern. Each "step" in the staircase is a link in the chain.
