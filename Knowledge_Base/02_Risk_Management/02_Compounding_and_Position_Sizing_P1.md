# Lesson 2: Compounding Effect and Position Sizing (Part 1)

This lesson focuses on the mathematical mechanics of trading. It explains how to translate a risk percentage into a specific trade size, ensuring that every trade adheres to the risk management rules established in Lesson 1.

## The Position Sizing Formula

The most critical calculation for any trader is determining the position size. The formula used in this course is:

> **Position Size = (Account Risk in Dollars) / (Stop Loss Distance in Dollars)**

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1.  **Determine Account Risk**: Calculate the dollar amount you are willing to lose based on your risk percentage (e.g., 1% of a $10,000 account = $100).
2.  **Identify Stop Loss Distance**: Measure the difference between your entry price and your stop-loss price in the asset's currency (e.g., Bitcoin entry at $30,000, stop-loss at $29,500 = $500 distance).
3.  **Calculate Size**: Divide the risk ($100) by the distance ($500) to get the position size (0.2 BTC).

## Key Takeaways

- **Fixed Risk, Variable Size**: Your risk in dollars remains constant, but your position size changes based on how "tight" or "wide" your stop-loss is.
- **The Power of Math**: Using this formula ensures that no matter how far away your stop-loss is, you will only ever lose your predetermined risk amount (e.g., $100).
- **Asset Neutrality**: This formula works for any asset (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Stocks, etc.) as long as you use the correct price units.

## Practical Example
- **Account**: $10,000
- **Risk**: 1% ($100)
- **Trade**: Long BTC at $40,000
- **Stop Loss**: $39,000 (Distance = $1,000)
- **Position Size**: $100 / $1,000 = **0.1 BTC**
