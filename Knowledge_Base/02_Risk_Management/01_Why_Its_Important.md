# Lesson 1: Why Risk Management is Important

Risk management is the cornerstone of professional trading. Without it, even the most profitable strategy will eventually lead to a total loss of capital. This lesson establishes the foundational mindset required to treat trading as a business rather than gambling.

## Core Concepts

1.  **Risk Tolerance vs. Risk Appetite**:
    - **Risk Tolerance**: The actual amount of capital you can afford to lose without affecting your lifestyle or emotional state.
    - **Risk Appetite**: The specific amount you *choose* to risk per trade, per day, or per week based on your strategy.
2.  **The Goal of Longevity**: The primary objective is to stay in the game. By keeping risks small and consistent, you ensure that a string of losses (which is inevitable) does not wipe out your account.
3.  **Emotional Control**: Strict risk rules remove the "gambler's high" and the "fear of loss." When you know exactly how much you will lose if a trade goes wrong, you can execute your strategy with clinical precision.

## Key Rules

- **Risk Per Trade**: Never risk more than a small, fixed percentage of your account (e.g., 1% or 2%).
- **Daily/Weekly Limits**: Establish a "max loss" for the day or week. If reached, stop trading immediately to prevent emotional "revenge trading."
- **Consistency**: The risk must be the same for every trade within a specific strategy to allow the law of large numbers to work in your favor.
