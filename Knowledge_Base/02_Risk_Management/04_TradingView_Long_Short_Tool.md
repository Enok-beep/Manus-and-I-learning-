# Lesson 4: Using the TradingView Long/Short Tool

While the manual position sizing formula is essential for understanding the math, TradingView provides a built-in tool that automates this process. This lesson explains how to configure and use the Long/Short Position tool to ensure accurate risk management.

## Tool Configuration

To use the tool for position sizing, you must first configure your account settings within the tool:

1.  **Account Size**: Enter your total trading capital (e.g., $10,000).
2.  **Risk Percentage**: Enter your fixed risk per trade (e.g., 1%).
3.  **Lot Size/Unit**: Ensure the tool is set to the correct asset units (e.g., BTC for Bitcoin).

## How to Use the Tool

1.  **Place the Tool**: Click on your desired entry point and drag the stop-loss and take-profit levels to your target prices.
2.  **Read the "Qty" (Quantity)**: The tool will automatically calculate the **Quantity** (Position Size) based on your account size and risk percentage.
3.  **Execute the Trade**: Copy the "Qty" value directly into your exchange's order entry field.

## Benefits of the Tool

- **Speed**: Allows for rapid trade execution during fast-moving market conditions.
- **Accuracy**: Eliminates human error in manual calculations.
- **Visual Confirmation**: Provides a clear visual representation of your risk-to-reward ratio (RRR) before you enter the trade.

## Warning: The "Account Balance" Trap
The tool only works if you **constantly update your account balance** in the tool's settings as your account grows or shrinks. If you forget to update the balance, your risk in dollars will be incorrect, breaking the compounding rules learned in Lesson 3.
