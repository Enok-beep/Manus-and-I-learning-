# Lesson 3: The Power of Compounding

Compounding is often called the "eighth wonder of the world." In trading, it is the process of reinvesting profits to grow the account exponentially rather than linearly. This lesson explores the two primary ways to manage risk as an account grows.

## Linear vs. Exponential Growth

| Method | Description | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fixed Dollar Risk** | Risking the same dollar amount (e.g., $100) on every trade regardless of account size. | Very safe; easy to manage emotionally. | Growth is slow and linear; does not capitalize on account growth. |
| **Compounding Risk** | Risking a fixed percentage (e.g., 1%) of the *current* account balance on every trade. | Growth is exponential; profits accelerate as the account grows. | Losses also "compound" (a 1% loss on a larger account is more dollars). |

## The "Grand Secret" of Compounding

The secret to successful compounding is **consistency**. If you risk 1% and make a 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio, your account grows by 2%. The next trade is then based on this new, larger balance. 

### The Math of Acceleration:
- **Trade 1**: $10,000 account -> 1% risk ($100) -> 2% gain = **$10,200**
- **Trade 100**: If the account has grown to $20,000 -> 1% risk ($200) -> 2% gain = **$400 profit** (double the profit for the same "risk percentage").

## Practical Implementation

1.  **Daily/Weekly Reset**: Most professional traders do not compound *every single trade*. Instead, they reset their "account balance" for risk calculations at the start of each day or week.
2.  **The "Safety Buffer"**: Some traders choose to only compound after reaching a certain milestone (e.g., every 10% gain) to protect their initial capital.

## Interconnection: Risk Management & Compounding
Compounding is the "engine" of the trading system, but Risk Management (Lesson 1 & 2) is the "brakes." Without the brakes, the engine will eventually crash the car. You must master the position sizing formula before you can safely apply compounding.
