# Lesson 5: Leverage Explained - The Great Misconception

Leverage is one of the most misunderstood concepts in trading. Many traders believe that higher leverage automatically means more profit or more risk. This lesson clarifies that **leverage is simply a tool to achieve your desired position size**, and it does not change your risk if your position sizing is correct.

## The Core Principle: Notional Size vs. Leverage

The most important takeaway from this lesson is that your **Risk** is determined by your **Position Size (Notional Size)** and your **Stop Loss**, not by the leverage multiplier you select on the exchange.

| Concept | Definition | Role in Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Notional Size** | The total dollar value of the asset you are controlling (e.g., 1 BTC at $40,000 = $40,000 Notional). | **Primary**. This determines how much you gain or lose per price tick. |
| **Leverage** | The ratio of your position size to your collateral (e.g., $1,000 collateral for a $10,000 position = 10x leverage). | **Secondary**. This only determines how much collateral (margin) is required to open the position. |

## Why Leverage Doesn't Change Risk (If Sized Correctly)

If your formula (from Lesson 2) tells you to buy **0.1694 BTC** to risk $100:
- At **5x leverage**, you will buy 0.1694 BTC.
- At **25x leverage**, you will buy 0.1694 BTC.
- At **75x leverage**, you will buy 0.1694 BTC.

In all three cases, if the price hits your stop loss, you lose exactly **$100**. The only difference is the amount of capital "locked up" as margin on the exchange.

## The Danger of High Leverage: Liquidation Risk

While leverage doesn't change your *trade risk*, it does change your **Liquidation Price**. 
- **Higher Leverage** = **Closer Liquidation Price**.
- If your liquidation price is *above* your stop loss (for a long), you will be liquidated before your stop loss is hit, which is a failure of risk management.

## Key Rule for Leverage
> **Always ensure your Liquidation Price is well beyond your Stop Loss.** 

If you have to use such high leverage that your liquidation price is inside your stop loss, you are over-leveraged and gambling, not trading.
