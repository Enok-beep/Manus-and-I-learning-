# Lesson 6: De-Risking and Trade Management

Opening a trade is only the beginning. Professional trading requires active management to protect profits and minimize losses as the trade develops. This lesson covers the "Black and White" rules for de-risking a position.

## The Concept of "Risk-Free" Trading

The goal of trade management is to move the trade to a "risk-free" state as quickly as possible. This is achieved by moving the stop-loss to the entry price (Break Even) after the price has moved a certain distance in your favor.

### Key Management Rules:

1.  **Take Profit 1 (TP1) & De-Risking**:
    - When the price reaches a predetermined level (often a 1:1 risk-to-reward ratio or a key structural level), close a portion of the position (e.g., 50%).
    - **Immediately** move the stop-loss for the remaining position to the entry price (Break Even).
    - At this point, the trade is "risk-free." Even if the price reverses, you have already secured profit from TP1 and will not lose money on the remainder.

2.  **Trailing Stop-Loss**:
    - As the price continues to move in your favor and breaks new structural levels, move your stop-loss behind those levels to lock in more profit.
    - **Rule**: Never move a stop-loss *further away* from the entry (increasing risk). Only move it *closer* or *past* the entry (decreasing risk).

3.  **Partial Take Profits**:
    - Instead of closing the entire position at one target, use multiple Take Profit levels (TP1, TP2, TP3).
    - This allows you to capture gains while still leaving a "runner" to capitalize on large market moves.

## The Psychological Benefit

Active de-risking significantly reduces trading stress. Once a trade is at Break Even, the emotional burden of "what if I lose?" is removed, allowing the trader to hold for larger targets with a clear mind.
