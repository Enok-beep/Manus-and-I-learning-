# 02 Risk Management: The Foundation of Trading

Risk management is the single most critical component of a sustainable trading system. It is the set of rules designed to protect trading capital and ensure longevity in the market.

## Core Principles

1.  **Define Risk Per Trade**: A trader must determine the maximum percentage of their total capital they are willing to lose on any single trade. This is often kept low, typically between 0.5% and 2%.
2.  **Position Sizing**: The size of a trade must be calculated based on the distance to the stop-loss and the defined risk per trade. This ensures that a loss, if it occurs, does not exceed the predetermined risk tolerance.
3.  **Black and White Rules**: Successful trading relies on strict, non-negotiable rules for entry, exit, and stop-loss placement. Deviating from these rules is a common cause of poor trading performance.
