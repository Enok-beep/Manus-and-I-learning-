# Lesson 04: Various Levels of MS Part 2

This lesson continues the deep-dive into the **Three Levels of Market Structure**, focusing on how to navigate "bigger moves" and avoid getting lost in the noise.

## The Challenge of Bigger Moves

> "So we're gonna look at some examples as to how price action can be quite difficult to look at when you have these larger moves in price. As you can see, it's quite easy to get lost within these larger moves."

The problem is that when the market makes a large move, it creates many internal structures that can be confusing. This lesson teaches you how to stay focused on what matters.

## The "All One Timeframe" Concept

The video title card shows: **"All One Timeframe - Bigger Moves and how to look at them"**

### The Key Insight
> "So if we pretend that we're looking at eeg, the 15 minute timeframe, and this is a 15 minute swing, a lower low, a 15 minute swing, lower high, a 50 minute swing, lower low, a lower high, lower low."

The key is to **stay on one timeframe** and identify the swing structure first. Don't jump between timeframes until you have a clear picture of the swing bias.

## The "Pretend" Method

> "And so far we do not know if this is going to be a lower high. And we pretend that these just so..."

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Identify the Swing Points**: Mark the major swing highs and lows on your chosen timeframe.
2. **Pretend the Next Move**: Before the market confirms, "pretend" what the next structural point will be (e.g., "this is going to be a lower high").
3. **Wait for Confirmation**: Only act when the market confirms your "pretend" scenario with a BOS.

## The "Grand Secret" of Bigger Moves

The "grand secret" is **Simplification Through Abstraction**. 
- When the market makes a big move, don't try to analyze every candle.
- Zoom out and identify the "swing" points.
- Treat the internal structure as "noise" until it confirms a swing-level change.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Bigger Moves |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Management** | In bigger moves, your stop-loss should be behind the swing structure, not the internal structure. |
| **Market Structure** | This lesson reinforces the hierarchy: Swing > Internal > Micro. |
| **Supply and Demand** | In bigger moves, focus on the HTF S&D zones. LTF zones are less reliable. |
| **Orderflow** | The RIMC cycle is more visible on the swing level. Internal RIMC cycles are "noise" within the larger cycle. |
