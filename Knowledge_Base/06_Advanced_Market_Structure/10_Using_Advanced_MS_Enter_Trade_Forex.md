# Lesson 10: Using Advanced MS To Enter a Trade - Forex

This is the final lesson of the **Advanced Market Structure** chapter (11:36), demonstrating the same methodology applied to **Forex** markets.

## Introduction

> "So we're actually gonna look at a Forex based example here of the exact same thing that we just looked at."

### The Goal:
- Apply the Advanced MS concepts to a **Forex chart**.
- Demonstrate that the methodology is **universal** across markets.
- Reinforce the process through repetition.

## The Forex Analysis

> "So we're looking at live market structure examples and how we're gonna look at various levels of internal structure and swing structure."

### The Setup:
- **Pair**: USD/CAD (or similar Forex pair)
- **Timeframes**: 6H, 1H, and lower timeframes for confirmation.

## The "Lower High" Identification

> "So quite clearly if we went to the, say the six hour timeframe, this would be a lower low. You had more than two up candles in a row, this would constitute a lower high. We had a bearish break of structure from left to right price ultimately came..."

### Key Insight:
- A **Lower High** is confirmed when you have "more than two up candles in a row" followed by a reversal.
- This is a **practical rule** for identifying structural points on Forex charts.
- The "bearish break of structure" confirms the trend direction.

## The "Grand Secret" of Forex Trading

The "grand secret" is **Market Universality**. 
- The same principles that work on Bitcoin work on Forex.
- The same principles that work on the 4H work on the 6H.
- The **methodology is universal**—only the market and timeframe change.

## Forex vs. Crypto Differences

| Aspect | Forex | Crypto (BTC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Volatility** | Lower, smoother moves | Higher, more erratic |
| **Session Times** | Defined (London, NY, Asia) | 24/7 |
| **Liquidity** | Very high | Variable |
| **Structure Clarity** | Often cleaner | Can be noisier |

### Practical Implication:
- Forex is often **easier to read** for beginners because the structure is cleaner.
- Crypto requires more **patience** and **discipline** due to higher volatility.

## The Entry Process (Forex)

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **6H/4H Analysis**: Identify the swing bias and the key swing highs/lows.
2. **1H Analysis**: Wait for internal structure to align with the swing bias.
3. **15m/5m Confirmation**: Look for a CHoCH or BOS in your direction.
4. **Execute**: Enter the trade with your stop behind the relevant structural point.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Forex Trading |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Management** | Forex has tighter spreads, allowing for tighter stops. |
| **Market Structure** | The 6H/1H/15m hierarchy is the practical application of the MS theory. |
| **Supply and Demand** | The entry is at a validated S&D zone on the 1H or 15m. |
| **Orderflow** | The 15m CHoCH is the "Initiation" phase of the RIMC cycle. |
