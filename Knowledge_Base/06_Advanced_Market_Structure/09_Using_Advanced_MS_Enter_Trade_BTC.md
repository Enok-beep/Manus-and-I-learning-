# Lesson 09: Using Advanced MS To Enter a Trade - BTC

This is a comprehensive, real-world application lesson (32:11) that demonstrates how to use **Advanced Market Structure** to find trade entries on **Bitcoin**.

## Introduction

> "So we're gonna try putting our market structure ideas together to see if we can come up with a result on Bitcoin here for a long or short idea."

### The Goal:
- Apply all the Advanced MS concepts to a **real Bitcoin chart**.
- Find a **long or short** trade idea.
- Demonstrate the **complete process** from analysis to entry.

## The Timeframe Selection

> "So clearly from the top, which is what we're gonna look at, we're not gonna go too far back with our structure. We're focusing on the four hour, the one hour, the 15, and possibly the five. We don't really need the three, the two of the one, depending on how you want to trade."

### Key Insight:
- **4H**: The "Swing" timeframe for overall bias.
- **1H**: The "Internal" timeframe for structure within the swing.
- **15m**: The "Entry" timeframe for confirmation.
- **5m**: Optional "Sniper" timeframe for precision entries.

> "If you want to find bigger trades and you don't really necessarily need those..."

### The Trade-Off:
- **Bigger Trades**: Use higher timeframes (4H, 1H).
- **Precision Entries**: Use lower timeframes (15m, 5m).
- The choice depends on your **trading style** and **risk tolerance**.

## The "Grand Secret" of BTC Trading

The "grand secret" is **Timeframe Hierarchy**. 
- Bitcoin is volatile, so you need a **clear hierarchy** to filter the noise.
- The 4H tells you the "story," the 1H tells you the "chapter," and the 15m tells you the "sentence."
- You only enter when all three are aligned.

## The Entry Process

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **4H Analysis**: Identify the swing bias and the key swing highs/lows.
2. **1H Analysis**: Wait for internal structure to align with the 4H bias.
3. **15m Confirmation**: Look for a CHoCH or BOS in your direction.
4. **Execute**: Enter the trade with your stop behind the relevant structural point.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to BTC Trading |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Management** | BTC is volatile, so position sizing is critical. |
| **Market Structure** | The 4H/1H/15m hierarchy is the practical application of the MS theory. |
| **Supply and Demand** | The entry is at a validated S&D zone on the 1H or 15m. |
| **Orderflow** | The 15m CHoCH is the "Initiation" phase of the RIMC cycle. |

## The "Bigger Trades" Philosophy

The key to "bigger trades" is **patience**. 
- Don't chase every move on the 5m chart.
- Wait for the 4H to set up, then let the 1H and 15m confirm.
- This approach reduces the number of trades but increases the quality.
