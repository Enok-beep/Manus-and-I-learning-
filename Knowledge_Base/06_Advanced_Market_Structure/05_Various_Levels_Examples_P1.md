# Lesson 05: Various Levels Examples Part 1

This is a comprehensive, example-driven lesson (36:51) that applies the **Three Levels of Market Structure** to real charts. The focus is on the USD/CAD Forex pair using Oanda Exchange.

## Introduction

> "This is lesson five in the advanced market structure series. So as of now, you guys should know that we have at least three levels of market structure."

### The Three Levels Recap:
1. **Swing Structure** (Primary)
2. **Internal Structure**
3. **Micro Structure** (Fractal)

> "And I say at least because you can have more than one level of fractal market structure."

## Why Forex Over Bitcoin for This Example

> "Using Oanda Exchange. And the reason why we're gonna look at this over Bitcoin is because I feel that it's much smoother in terms of structure and we make for a better example here."

### Key Insight:
- Forex markets are often "smoother" than crypto markets.
- This makes them easier to analyze for learning purposes.
- The same principles apply to all markets, but the "noise" is reduced in Forex.

## The USD/CAD Analysis

The lesson walks through a detailed analysis of the USD/CAD pair, demonstrating:
1. **Identifying Swing Structure**: Finding the major highs and lows on the HTF.
2. **Mapping Internal Structure**: Dropping to the MTF to see the internal moves within the swing.
3. **Spotting Entry Points**: Using micro structure to refine entries.

## The "Grand Secret" of Examples

The "grand secret" is **Pattern Recognition Through Repetition**. 
- By studying many examples, you train your eye to see structure automatically.
- The goal is to reach a point where you don't have to "think" about structure—you just "see" it.
- This is the "muscle memory" that Jayson Casper mentioned in the Market Structure chapter.

## Practical Application

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Start with the HTF**: Identify the swing bias (bullish or bearish).
2. **Drop to the MTF**: Wait for internal structure to align with the swing bias.
3. **Drop to the LTF**: Look for a micro CHoCH or BOS to confirm your entry.
4. **Execute**: Enter the trade with your stop behind the relevant structural point.

## Connection to Previous Chapters
