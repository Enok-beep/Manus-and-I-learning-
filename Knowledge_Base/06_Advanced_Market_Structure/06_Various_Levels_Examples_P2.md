# Lesson 06: Various Levels Examples Part 2

This lesson continues the example-driven approach (18:34), focusing on **putting theory into practice** to find valid trade ideas.

## Introduction

> "So we're basically going to be using all the theory, putting it together to figure out how we can actually get a valid trade idea and how we can actually analyze using this, right? At the end of the day, that's what we wanna figure out. All right."

### The Goal:
- Move from **theory** to **practical application**.
- Learn how to identify **valid trade ideas** using multiple levels of structure.

## The "Purple Leg" Analysis

> "We're gonna investigate this last purple leg and on the one hour timeframe, which is, I was on the two, but now I'm on the one."

### Key Insight:
- The "purple leg" refers to a specific move on the chart that Jayson is analyzing.
- He switches between the **2-hour** and **1-hour** timeframes to get a clearer picture.
- This demonstrates the importance of **timeframe flexibility** when analyzing structure.

## Wiping Supply Boxes

> "We will actually wipe these supply boxes because we don't really need that kind of just overkill there. So price from the high came down to this..."

### The "Overkill" Problem:
- When you mark too many S&D zones, your chart becomes cluttered.
- The solution is to **wipe** (remove) the zones that are no longer relevant.
- Focus only on the zones that are **active** and **aligned** with your current analysis.

## The "Grand Secret" of Examples Part 2

The "grand secret" is **Selective Analysis**. 
- You don't need to analyze every move on the chart.
- Focus on the **most recent, most relevant** structural moves.
- Remove clutter to see the "clean" picture.

## Practical Application

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Identify the Key Leg**: Find the most recent impulsive move (the "purple leg").
2. **Drop to a Lower Timeframe**: Get a clearer picture of the internal structure.
3. **Wipe Irrelevant Zones**: Remove S&D zones that are no longer active.
4. **Identify the Entry Zone**: Find the S&D zone that aligns with the current structure.
5. **Execute**: Enter the trade with your stop behind the relevant structural point.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Examples Part 2 |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Management** | By wiping irrelevant zones, you reduce confusion and make better risk decisions. |
| **Market Structure** | The "purple leg" is just another name for the "primary base leg" from the Framework lesson. |
| **Supply and Demand** | This lesson teaches you how to **filter** S&D zones for relevance. |
| **Orderflow** | The "purple leg" is the "Initiation" phase of the RIMC cycle. |
