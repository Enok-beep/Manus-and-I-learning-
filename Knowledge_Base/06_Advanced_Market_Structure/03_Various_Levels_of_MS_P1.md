# Lesson 03: Various Levels of MS Part 1

This lesson introduces the **Three Levels of Market Structure**: Swing (Primary), Internal, and Micro. Understanding these levels is critical for precise entry and exit timing.

## The Three Levels of Market Structure

Based on the video title card, this lesson covers:
- **Swing Structure (Primary)**: The largest, HTF structural moves.
- **Swing Internal Structure**: The medium-sized moves within the swing structure.

### The Hierarchy

| Level | Timeframe | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Swing (Primary)** | HTF (Daily, 4H) | Defines the overall bias and major targets. |
| **Internal** | MTF (1H, 15m) | Provides entry opportunities within the swing move. |
| **Micro** | LTF (5m, 1m) | Refines entries to the exact candle. |

## The "Fractal" Nature of Structure

The key concept is that **structure is fractal**. 
- Every swing move is made up of internal moves.
- Every internal move is made up of micro moves.
- The same rules (BOS, CHoCH, Protected/Targeted) apply at every level.

## How to Use the Levels Together

### Step 1: Identify the Swing Bias
- Look at the HTF (Daily, 4H) to determine if the market is bullish or bearish.
- This tells you **which direction** to trade.

### Step 2: Wait for Internal Structure Alignment
- Drop to the MTF (1H, 15m) and wait for internal structure to align with the swing bias.
- This tells you **when** to look for an entry.

### Step 3: Refine Entry with Micro Structure
- Drop to the LTF (5m, 1m) and look for a micro CHoCH or BOS in the direction of your trade.
- This tells you **where exactly** to enter.

## The "Grand Secret" of Various Levels

The "grand secret" is **Precision Through Layering**. 
- The more levels of structure that align, the higher the probability of the trade.
- A trade that has Swing, Internal, and Micro alignment is a "sniper" entry.
- A trade that only has Swing alignment is a "commander" entry (wider stop, lower precision).

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Various Levels |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Management** | The level of structure you use determines your stop-loss distance. Micro = tight stop. Swing = wide stop. |
| **Market Structure** | This lesson is the "advanced" version of Internal vs. Swing (Lesson 3.04). |
| **Supply and Demand** | Each level of structure has its own S&D zones. HTF zones are more powerful. |
| **Orderflow** | The RIMC cycle occurs at every level. You can have a micro RIMC within an internal RIMC within a swing RIMC. |
