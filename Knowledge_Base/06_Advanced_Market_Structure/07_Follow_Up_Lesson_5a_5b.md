# Lesson 07: Follow Up For Lesson 5a and 5b

This is an **update video** (06:41) that shows how the trade ideas from the previous examples actually played out in real-time.

## Introduction

> "So this is actually going to be an update video. Very interestingly, I started this video a couple of months ago, um, in the advanced market structure series. Today's date is August 22nd, 2023, and it was around the 5th of July, the 6th of July when I actually took the video originally."

### The Purpose:
- This lesson is a **follow-up** to the examples in Lessons 5a and 5b.
- It shows how the trade ideas **actually played out** over the following months.
- This is critical for building **confidence** in the system.

## The Trade Outcome

> "So it has been quite interesting to see this idea play out. I thought, you know what? I'm actually gonna show an update video on how this actually played out because the idea that we had it worked. So let's..."

### Key Insight:
- The trade idea from the examples **worked**.
- This validates the methodology and provides real-world proof of the system's effectiveness.

## The "Grand Secret" of Follow-Ups

The "grand secret" is **Accountability and Validation**. 
- Most trading educators never show follow-ups.
- By showing how the trade played out, Jayson Casper demonstrates:
  1. **Honesty**: He's willing to show the results, good or bad.
  2. **Confidence**: He believes in the system enough to put it on record.
  3. **Learning**: Even if a trade fails, the follow-up provides valuable lessons.

## Practical Application

### What to Do After Taking a Trade:
1. **Document the Setup**: Take a screenshot of your analysis.
2. **Wait for the Outcome**: Let the trade play out.
3. **Review the Result**: Did it work? Why or why not?
4. **Learn and Iterate**: Use the follow-up to improve your future analysis.
