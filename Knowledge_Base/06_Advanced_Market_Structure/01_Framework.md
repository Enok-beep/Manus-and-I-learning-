# Lesson 01: Framework

This lesson introduces the **Framework** that underlies all advanced market structure analysis. It establishes the "Primary Base Leg" as the foundation for understanding how price moves.

## The Framework

> "Now we're gonna go over the framework that's actually behind market structure. So of course you're always going to have what you refer to as a primary base leg."

The framework is built on the concept of the **Primary Base Leg**—the foundational move that all subsequent price action references.

## The Primary Base Leg

### Definition
- The **Primary Base Leg** is the initial impulsive move that establishes the direction of the market.
- Within a primary base leg, a **retracement always occurs**.

### The Retracement Rule
> "And within a primary base leg, a retracement always occurs. This is a very brief description just to get your head around how market structure actually works before you look at any of these advanced market structure videos."

| Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Base Leg** | The initial impulsive move (e.g., from a swing low to a swing high). |
| **Retracement** | The pullback that occurs within the primary base leg. |
| **Continuation** | The move that follows the retracement, continuing in the direction of the primary base leg. |

## The "Grand Secret" of the Framework

> "Now it's fairly common knowledge. That price, in order to get from here down to here, there has to be..."

The "grand secret" is that **price does not move in a straight line**. 
- Every impulsive move is followed by a retracement.
- The retracement is where you find your entry.
- The continuation is where you find your profit.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Framework |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Management** | The retracement defines your stop loss (behind the origin of the primary base leg). |
| **Market Structure** | The primary base leg is the "swing" move. The retracement creates the internal structure. |
| **Supply and Demand** | The origin of the primary base leg is your S&D zone. |
| **Orderflow** | The framework is the "R-I-M-C" cycle: Range → Initiation (Primary Base Leg) → Mitigation (Retracement) → Continuation. |
