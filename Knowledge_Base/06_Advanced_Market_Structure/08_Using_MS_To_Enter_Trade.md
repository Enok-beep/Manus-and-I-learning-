# Lesson 08: Using MS To Enter a Trade

This lesson (10:12) bridges the gap between **analysis** and **execution**, showing how to use Market Structure to actually enter a trade.

## Introduction

> "Alright, so we're gonna look at using market structure to enter a trade, to confirm a trade and to look for a higher probability."

### The Goal:
- Move from **analysis** to **action**.
- Use Market Structure to **confirm** trade entries.
- Increase the **probability** of success.

## Why This Lesson is Near the End

> "I put this in the advanced market structure section near the end because I feel like everything else is a must have. Like getting through the market structure series, getting through the order flow series, getting through the advanced market structure series entirely before truly going to use this stuff to enter a live trade, right? Like this stuff obviously goes hand in hand..."

### Key Insight:
- This lesson is intentionally placed **near the end** of the Advanced MS section.
- You **must** understand all the previous concepts before attempting to enter trades.
- The concepts are **interconnected**—you can't skip steps.

## The "Grand Secret" of Entry

The "grand secret" is **Confluence of Confirmation**. 
- You don't enter a trade based on one signal.
- You enter when **multiple levels of structure** align.
- This is the "hand in hand" relationship Jayson mentions.

## The Entry Checklist

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **HTF Bias**: Determine the overall direction (bullish or bearish).
2. **Swing Structure**: Identify the swing highs and lows.
3. **Internal Structure**: Wait for internal structure to align with the swing bias.
4. **POI Identification**: Find the S&D zone where you expect price to react.
5. **LTF Confirmation**: Drop to the LTF and wait for a CHoCH or BOS in your direction.
6. **Execute**: Enter the trade with your stop behind the relevant structural point.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Entry |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Management** | The entry point determines your stop loss distance and position size. |
| **Market Structure** | The entry is based on structural alignment across multiple timeframes. |
| **Supply and Demand** | The entry is at a validated S&D zone. |
| **Orderflow** | The entry is confirmed by a CHoCH or BOS on the LTF (the "Initiation" phase). |

## The "Higher Probability" Factor

The key to "higher probability" is **waiting for all the pieces to align**. 
- If the HTF is bullish but the internal structure is bearish, **wait**.
- If the internal structure is bullish but you're not at a POI, **wait**.
- If you're at a POI but there's no LTF confirmation, **wait**.

Patience is the ultimate edge.
