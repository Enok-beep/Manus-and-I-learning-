# Lesson 02: Overlapping Structure Pulls

This lesson explains **Overlapping Structure Pulls**—when to change the "structure pole" you are using to manage your trade, especially for stop-loss placement.

## The Core Concept

> "Today we're gonna talk a little bit about when it's appropriate to change the structure pole that you're currently using."

The "structure pole" is the structural point (e.g., a Higher Low or Lower High) that you are using as your reference for stop-loss placement. This lesson teaches you when to **switch** from one pole to another.

## Primary vs. Internal Structure

> "When to use primary versus internal, especially to help us with a stop-loss in a position."

| Structure Type | Description | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary (Swing)** | The larger, HTF structural points. | Initial stop-loss placement. |
| **Internal** | The smaller, LTF structural points within the primary move. | Trailing stop-loss after the trade is in profit. |

## The "Overlapping" Problem

When price moves, it creates new internal structure. Sometimes, this new internal structure "overlaps" with the previous primary structure. This creates confusion about which level to use.

### The Solution: The "Fresh Spot" Rule

> "This is a fresh spot that I picked that we're gonna go over together."

The rule is to use the **most recent, valid structural point** that has not been violated.

## Example: Order Block and Structure Pulls

> "100% together. So in this case here, we're gonna use our imagination. We're gonna pretend that there was an order block here."

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Identify the Primary Structure**: The swing high/low that defines the current trend.
2. **Enter at the Order Block**: Use the S&D zone for your entry.
3. **Place Initial Stop Behind Primary Structure**: Your stop is behind the swing low (for longs).
4. **As Price Creates New Internal Structure**: Identify the new internal HL.
5. **Trail Stop to Internal Structure**: Move your stop behind the new internal HL.

## The "Grand Secret" of Overlapping Structure

The "grand secret" is **Adaptive Risk Management**. 
- Your stop-loss is not static; it evolves with the market.
- By trailing your stop to new internal structure, you are locking in profits while still giving the trade room to breathe.
- The key is to only move your stop when the new structure is **valid** (i.e., it has caused a BOS).

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Overlapping Structure |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Management** | This lesson is the "advanced" version of De-Risking (Lesson 2.06). It teaches you *where* to move your stop. |
| **Market Structure** | The "structure pole" is just another name for a Protected Level. |
| **Supply and Demand** | The Order Block is your entry. The structure pole is your protection. |
| **Orderflow** | The "overlapping" structure is the internal structure created during the Mitigation and Continuation phases. |
