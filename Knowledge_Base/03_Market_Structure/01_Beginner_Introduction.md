# Lesson 1: Beginner Introduction to Market Structure

Market Structure (MS) is the foundation of all technical analysis. It is the "skeleton" of the market that tells you the direction of the trend and where the big players are moving price. Without understanding MS, indicators and strategies will often give false signals.

## The Three Types of Market Trends

| Trend Type | Definition | Visual Characteristic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bullish (Uptrend)** | Price is making Higher Highs (HH) and Higher Lows (HL). | Staircasing upwards. |
| **Bearish (Downtrend)** | Price is making Lower Highs (LH) and Lower Lows (LL). | Staircasing downwards. |
| **Ranging (Sideways)** | Price is trapped between a clear high and a clear low. | Moving horizontally. |

## Why Market Structure is the "Foundation"

Jayson Casper uses the analogy of building a house:
- **Market Structure** is the foundation and the frame.
- **Supply/Demand & Orderflow** are the walls and the roof.
- **Indicators & Fibonacci** are the decorations and furniture.

If your foundation (MS) is weak or misunderstood, the entire house (your trade) will collapse, no matter how good your indicators look.

## Core Concept: The "Trend is Your Friend"

The primary goal of identifying MS is to determine the **Bias**:
- If MS is Bullish, you only look for **Longs**.
- If MS is Bearish, you only look for **Shorts**.
- Trading against the structure is "swimming against the current" and significantly lowers your win rate.

## Interconnection: MS & Risk Management

Market Structure tells you **where to put your stop loss**. 
- In an uptrend, your stop loss goes below the previous **Higher Low**.
- If that Higher Low is broken, the structure has changed, and your original trade idea is invalidated. This is the "Black and White" reason for exiting a trade.
