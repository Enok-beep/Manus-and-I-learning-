# Lesson 4: Using Various Levels of Structure (Internal vs. Swing)

This lesson explores the hierarchical nature of Market Structure and how to distinguish between the major "Swing" moves and the minor "Internal" moves.

## The Hierarchy of Structure

Market structure is not a single line; it is a series of nested trends. Understanding the relationship between these levels is the key to high-probability trading.

### 1. Swing Structure (The "Big Picture")
- **Definition**: The major highs and lows on your primary trading timeframe.
- **Purpose**: Defines the overall trend and the "Trading Range" you are currently in.
- **Visual**: These are the obvious "peaks" and "valleys" that you see when you zoom out on your chart.

### 2. Internal Structure (The "Sub-Trend")
- **Definition**: The structure that forms *within* a single swing leg (e.g., the HHs and HLs that form as price moves from a Swing Low to a Swing High).
- **Purpose**: Provides early signals of a potential shift in the Swing trend.
- **Visual**: These are the smaller fluctuations that occur between the major swing points.

## The "Grand Secret" of Interconnection

The relationship between Internal and Swing structure is the core of the "Smart Money" approach:

1.  **The Leading Indicator**: A change in **Internal Structure** (a CHoCH on the LTF) is the first sign that a **Swing High or Low** is being formed.
2.  **The Trend Alignment**: The highest probability trades occur when the **Internal Structure aligns with the Swing Structure**. (e.g., in a Bullish Swing trend, you look for a Bullish Internal BOS to enter).
3.  **The Structural Trap**: Many retail traders mistake an Internal BOS for a full trend reversal. Professional traders know that as long as the **Swing Low** is defended, the bullish trend is still intact, regardless of what the internal structure is doing.

## Practical Application: The "Fractal" View

- **Swing Structure** = The "Forest" (Where are we going?)
- **Internal Structure** = The "Trees" (How are we getting there?)

By mapping both, you can identify "Pro-Trend" entries where you are trading with the momentum of both the internal and swing levels.
