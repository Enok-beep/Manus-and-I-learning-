# Lesson 2: Introduction to Market Structure (Deep Dive)

This lesson moves beyond the basics to explore the technical mechanics of how Market Structure (MS) is formed and how to identify the specific points that define a trend.

## The Mechanics of Structure

Market structure is formed by the interaction of buyers and sellers at key price levels. A trend is confirmed not just by price movement, but by the **successful creation and defense** of structural points.

### Bullish Structure (Uptrend)
- **Higher High (HH)**: Price breaks above the previous high.
- **Higher Low (HL)**: Price pulls back but stays above the previous low.
- **Confirmation**: A bullish trend is confirmed when price breaks the previous HH, creating a new HH.

### Bearish Structure (Downtrend)
- **Lower Low (LL)**: Price breaks below the previous low.
- **Lower High (LH)**: Price pulls back but stays below the previous high.
- **Confirmation**: A bearish trend is confirmed when price breaks the previous LL, creating a new LL.

## The "Swing" Points

Jayson Casper emphasizes identifying **Swing Highs** and **Swing Lows**. These are the "anchor points" for your analysis.
- A valid Swing High/Low must be clearly visible and represent a significant turning point in price.It consists at least two consequitive bullish/bearish candles in each given time frame. E.g - 2 min time frame at least two consequitive bullish/bearish candles visible but on 5 min time frame is only one bullish/bearish visible, that means the MS swing high/low is valid only valid in 2 min time frame but not in 5 min time frame.
- **Rule of Thumb**: If you have to squint to see it, it's probably not a major structural point.

## Multi-Timeframe Perspective

Structure exists on every timeframe, from the 1-minute to the Monthly.
- **Higher Timeframe (HTF)**: Defines the overall "Big Picture" bias.
- **Lower Timeframe (LTF)**: Used for entries and identifying early signs of a structural shift.
- **The Golden Rule**: HTF structure always carries more weight than LTF structure.

## Interconnection: MS & The "Grand Secret"

The "grand secret" starting to emerge is that **Market Structure is Fractal**. What looks like a single line on the Daily chart is a complex series of HHs and HLs on the 15-minute chart. 
- To be a "Deep" trader, you must learn to see the **internal structure** within the **swing structure**.
- A change in LTF structure is often the first signal that a HTF structural point is about to be created or broken.
