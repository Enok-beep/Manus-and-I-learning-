# Lesson 10: Protected Vs Targeted Highs/Lows

This lesson formalizes the concept of "Strong" and "Weak" structural points, providing clear rules for which levels should hold (Protected) and which levels should be run over (Targeted).

## The Definitions

### 1. Protected High/Low (Strong)
- **Definition**: A structural point that has successfully "done its job" by creating a new BOS in the direction of the trend.
- **Rule**: In a bullish trend, the **Higher Low** is protected. In a bearish trend, the **Lower High** is protected.
- **Trading Application**: Your stop loss should always be placed behind a Protected level.

### 2. Targeted High/Low (Weak)
- **Definition**: A structural point that has failed to create a new BOS or is the "destination" of the current trend leg.
- **Rule**: In a bullish trend, the **Higher High** is targeted. In a bearish trend, the **Lower Low** is targeted.
- **Trading Application**: These levels are your **Take Profit (TP)** targets.

## The "Grand Secret" of Protected/Targeted

The interconnection here is the **Validation of Risk**:
- If you are in a Long position and the **Protected Low** is broken, your trade is invalid.
- If you are in a Long position and the **Targeted High** is reached, your trade has completed its objective.
- **The Solution**: By identifying these levels, you remove the guesswork from your exits. You know exactly where you are wrong (Protected) and exactly where you are right (Targeted). This connects back to **Risk Management**: it allows you to calculate your **Risk/Reward Ratio** with 100% accuracy before you even enter the trade.
