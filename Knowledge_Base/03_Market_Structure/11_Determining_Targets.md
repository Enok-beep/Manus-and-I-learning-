# Lesson 11: Determining Targets

This lesson expands on the concept of "Targeted" levels, teaching you how to use Market Structure to identify multiple, high-probability profit-taking zones.

## The Hierarchy of Targets

Targets are not just the next high or low; they are a series of structural objectives that price seeks to complete.

### 1. The Immediate Target (Internal)
- **Definition**: The next internal structural point on your execution timeframe.
- **Purpose**: Used for **TP1 (Take Profit 1)** and moving your stop to break even.
- **Rule**: Once this target is hit, the trade is "De-Risked" (Lesson 2.06).

### 2. The Primary Target (Swing)
- **Definition**: The major Swing High or Swing Low of the current HTF trading range.
- **Purpose**: The main objective of the trade.
- **Rule**: This is where you take the majority of your profit (e.g., 80%).

### 3. The Extension Target (HTF)
- **Definition**: Structural points on a higher timeframe (e.g., a Daily high when trading the 4H).
- **Purpose**: Used for "Runners" to capture massive trend moves.

## The "Grand Secret" of Targeting

The interconnection here is between **Targeting and Liquidity Grabs**:
- Most targets are hit because they are "Liquidity Pools."
- Price doesn't just "stop" at a target; it often "runs" it to consume the orders sitting there.
- **The Solution**: Don't place your TP exactly *at* the high/low. Place it slightly *before* to ensure you get filled, or wait for the "run" and exit on the reversal signal (SFP). This connects back to **Risk Management**: by having a clear hierarchy of targets, you ensure that you are always paid for your risk, even if the full swing target is never reached.
