# Lesson 9: Determining the Overall Bias

This lesson is the culmination of the Market Structure theory, teaching you how to synthesize multiple timeframes and structural signals to determine a clear "Bias" (Bullish or Bearish) for your trading day, week, or month.

## The Multi-Timeframe (MTF) Framework

Determining bias is not about looking at one chart; it's about understanding the "Flow" of structure across timeframes.

### 1. The Anchor Timeframe (HTF)
- **Timeframes**: Weekly, Daily, or 4H.
- **Purpose**: Defines the "Swing" trend and the major trading range.
- **Rule**: You should never trade against the HTF bias unless you see a confirmed structural shift on that same timeframe.

### 2. The Execution Timeframe (LTF)
- **Timeframes**: 1H, 15m, or 5m.
- **Purpose**: Used to find entries that align with the HTF bias.
- **The Connection**: We look for an **Internal BOS** on the LTF to signal that the HTF trend is resuming.

## Step-by-Step Bias Determination

Jayson Casper outlines a systematic process:
1.  **Identify the HTF Swing Points**: Where is the last Strong High and Strong Low?
2.  **Determine the Current Leg**: Are we in an expansion leg or a retracement leg?
3.  **Check for Structural Failures**: Have we seen any SFPs or failed expansions on the HTF?
4.  **Look for LTF Alignment**: Is the internal structure on the LTF moving in the same direction as the HTF swing?

## The "Grand Secret" of Bias

The interconnection here is the **Law of Probability**:
- **HTF Bullish + LTF Bullish** = High Probability Long.
- **HTF Bullish + LTF Bearish** = Counter-Trend (Low Probability).
- **The Solution**: The "Smart Money" approach is to wait for the LTF to "flip" back into alignment with the HTF. This is the "grand secret" of timing—you don't guess the bottom; you wait for the LTF to confirm the HTF bias.
