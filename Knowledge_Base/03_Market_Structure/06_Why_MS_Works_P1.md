# Lesson 6: Why Market Structure Works (Part 1)

This lesson explores the underlying logic and psychology that makes Market Structure a reliable tool for predicting price movement.

## The "Why" Behind the Patterns

Market Structure works because it is a visual representation of the **Supply and Demand imbalance** in the market. It is not just lines on a chart; it is the footprint of big money.

### 1. The Path of Least Resistance
- Price moves in trends because it is seeking the "path of least resistance."
- In an uptrend, the resistance (Supply) is being overcome by Demand.
- Market Structure (HHs and HLs) shows you exactly where the "support" is being built to push price higher.

### 2. The Psychology of the "Crowd"
- Most retail traders trade based on emotion (fear and greed).
- Professional traders (Smart Money) use Market Structure to exploit these emotions.
- **The Trap**: Retail traders often buy at the HH (Greed) and sell at the HL (Fear). Market Structure allows you to do the opposite—buying the HL and selling the HH.

## The Role of "Liquidity"

Jayson Casper introduces the concept of **Liquidity** as the fuel for Market Structure:
- Big players need "Liquidity" (other people's orders) to fill their large positions.
- Structural points (HHs and LLs) are where most retail traders place their stop losses.
- **The Grand Secret**: Market Structure often moves *towards* these points to "grab liquidity" before continuing the trend. This is why the "Body vs. Wick" rule (Lesson 3) is so important—it helps you distinguish between a trend continuation and a liquidity grab.

## Interconnection: MS & Orderflow

This lesson provides the first deep link to the **Orderflow** chapter (Chapter 4):
- Market Structure is the *result*.
- Orderflow is the *cause*.
- By understanding *why* structure forms (the interaction of orders), you can anticipate the *result* (the next BOS) with much higher accuracy.
