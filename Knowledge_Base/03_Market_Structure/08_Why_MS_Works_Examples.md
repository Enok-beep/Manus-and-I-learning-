# Lesson 8: Why Market Structure Works (Examples)

This lesson provides real-world chart examples of the concepts discussed in the previous two lessons, specifically focusing on how to identify "Failed" structure and Swing Failure Patterns (SFPs) in real-time.

## Key Example: The Bitcoin SFP

Jayson Casper uses a Bitcoin chart to demonstrate a classic SFP:
- **The Setup**: Price creates a clear structural high (Swing High).
- **The Move**: Price pushes above that high, trapping breakout buyers and hitting the stop losses of early shorters.
- **The Failure**: Price fails to close above the high on the HTF (e.g., 4H or Daily) and quickly reverses.
- **The Result**: This "Failed Expansion" signals that the trend is exhausted and a deep retracement or reversal is likely.

## Identifying "Weak" vs. "Strong" Highs/Lows

Through the examples, we can refine our definitions:
- **Strong High/Low**: A structural point that successfully "did its job" by creating a new BOS in the direction of the trend.
- **Weak High/Low**: A structural point that failed to create a new BOS. These are "Targeted" levels because they have a high probability of being run over for liquidity.

## The "Grand Secret" of Example Analysis

The interconnection here is between **Timeframe Alignment and Structural Validity**:
1.  An SFP on a 15m chart is "noise" if it occurs in the middle of a 4H expansion leg.
2.  An SFP on a 4H chart at a Daily structural high is a "High Probability" reversal signal.
3.  **The Solution**: Always look for structural failures on the timeframe that matches the "Swing" structure you are trading. This is how you filter out the "fake" signals.
