# Lesson 3: Break of Structure (BOS)

The **Break of Structure (BOS)** is the most critical event in Market Structure analysis. It is the definitive signal that a trend is continuing or that a potential reversal is beginning.

## What is a BOS?

A BOS occurs when price moves beyond a previously established structural point (a HH in an uptrend or a LL in a downtrend).

### Bullish BOS
- In an uptrend, price creates a **Higher High (HH)**.
- Price pulls back to create a **Higher Low (HL)**.
- When price then breaks above the previous HH, a **Bullish BOS** has occurred.
- This confirms the continuation of the bullish trend.

### Bearish BOS
- In a downtrend, price creates a **Lower Low (LL)**.
- Price pulls back to create a **Lower High (LH)**.
- When price then breaks below the previous LL, a **Bearish BOS** has occurred.
- This confirms the continuation of the bearish trend.

## The "Body vs. Wick" Rule

Jayson Casper teaches a specific, "Black and White" rule for confirming a BOS:
- **The Rule**: A valid BOS requires a **candle body close** beyond the structural point.
- **The Logic**: A wick break (where price goes past the level but closes back inside) is often just a "liquidity grab" or a "fakeout." A body close represents a true shift in market commitment.

## Change of Character (CHoCH) vs. BOS

While both involve breaking structure, they serve different purposes:
- **BOS**: Confirms **trend continuation**. (e.g., HH -> HL -> HH break).
- **CHoCH**: Signals a **potential trend reversal**. It is the *first* time the market fails to defend a structural point (e.g., in an uptrend, price breaks below the previous HL).

## Interconnection: BOS & Risk Management

The BOS is the "trigger" for many of the Risk Management rules we learned in Chapter 2:
- **Stop Loss Placement**: Your stop loss should always be placed behind the structural point that *caused* the BOS. If that point is broken, the BOS is invalidated.
- **De-Risking**: A common rule is to move your stop loss to "Break Even" only *after* a new BOS has occurred in your direction. This ensures you are protected by a new level of structure.
