# Lesson 12: Staircasing a BOS

This lesson covers the "Staircasing" pattern, which is a specific way price moves through structure during a strong, healthy trend.

## The Staircasing Pattern

### 1. The Definition
- **Staircasing** occurs when price creates a BOS, retraces to a "Strong" structural point (Protected level), and then creates a new BOS.
- This creates a visual "staircase" on the chart.

### 2. The Significance
- **Trend Strength**: A clean staircase indicates a very strong trend with high participation from "Smart Money."
- **Entry Opportunities**: Each "step" in the staircase (the retracement) is a high-probability entry point.

## The "Grand Secret" of Staircasing

The interconnection here is between **Staircasing and Trend Exhaustion**:
- As long as the staircase is intact (Protected levels are holding), the trend is healthy.
- The "grand secret" is to look for the **"Broken Step."** 
- When price fails to create a new "step" (a failed expansion) or breaks a "Protected" level, the staircase is broken. This is your earliest signal that the trend is reversing.
- **The Solution**: Use the staircase to trail your stop loss. Move your stop behind each new "step" (Protected Low/High) as it is confirmed by a new BOS. This connects back to **Risk Management**: it allows you to lock in profits while giving the trade room to breathe within the healthy structural flow.
