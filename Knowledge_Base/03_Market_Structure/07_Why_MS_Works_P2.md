# Lesson 7: Why Market Structure Works (Part 2)

This lesson continues the exploration of the mechanics behind Market Structure, focusing on the specific behavior of price as it interacts with structural points and the concept of "Failed" structure.

## The Concept of "Failed" Structure

A key takeaway from this lesson is that Market Structure is not just about where price goes, but where it **fails** to go.

### 1. Failed Expansion
- If price attempts to create a new HH but fails to close above the previous HH, the "expansion leg" has failed.
- This is a major signal of weakness in an uptrend.
- **The Connection**: This often leads to a "Liquidity Grab" or a "Swing Failure Pattern (SFP)" where price wicks above the high but closes back inside.

### 2. The Job of a Low/High
- In an uptrend, the "job" of a Higher Low (HL) is to facilitate the creation of a new Higher High (HH).
- If a HL fails to produce a new HH, that HL is now considered "weak" or "targeted."
- **The Grand Secret**: Market Structure is a series of "jobs." When a structural point fails to do its job, the market will likely move to consume the liquidity sitting behind that point.

## SFP (Swing Failure Pattern) Introduction

Jayson Casper introduces the SFP as a specific type of structural failure:
- **What it is**: Price moves beyond a structural high/low but fails to close there, quickly reversing.
- **Why it works**: It traps retail traders who are buying the "breakout" and hits the stop losses of those who were shorting.
- **The Rule**: SFPs are most powerful when they occur at HTF structural points.

## Interconnection: MS & Liquidity (Deep Dive)

This lesson solidifies the link between **Market Structure** and **Liquidity**:
- Structural points are not just support/resistance; they are targets.
- A "Failed" structure turns a protected level into a targeted level.
- This connects directly to **Risk Management**: if you see a failed expansion, you should be extremely cautious about holding your position, as the "job" of the trend has not been completed.
