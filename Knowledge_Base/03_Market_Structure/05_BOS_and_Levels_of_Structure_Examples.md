# Lesson 05: BOS and Levels of Structure Examples

## Chapter: Market Structure
## Duration: 18:09
## Instructor: White Phoenix (Jayson Casper)

---

## Overview

This lesson provides practical, real-world examples of the concepts covered in the previous lessons on Market Structure. White Phoenix walks through live chart examples to demonstrate how to identify a valid Break of Structure (BOS) and how to differentiate between various levels of structure (Swing, Internal, and Middle). This lesson is critical for bridging the gap between theory and application, showing traders how to apply these concepts in a dynamic market environment.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Practical BOS Identification

This lesson moves beyond the theory of BOS and shows how to identify it on a live chart. The key is to focus on **candle body closes** above a swing high or below a swing low.

**Key Rules for BOS:**
- A BOS is only confirmed when a candle **body** closes beyond the previous structure point.
- A **wick** breaking a structure point is not a BOS; it is a liquidity grab or a failed attempt to break structure.
- The examples in this lesson reinforce the importance of this distinction.

### 2. Differentiating Levels of Structure in Practice

White Phoenix provides a visual guide to identifying the hierarchy of market structure on a single chart:

| Structure Level | Characteristics | Role in Trading |
|---|---|---|
| **Swing Structure** | The major, most obvious highs and lows on your primary timeframe. | Defines the overall trend and long-term bias. |
| **Internal Structure** | The smaller price swings that occur *within* a single leg of the swing structure. | Provides early clues about potential changes in the swing structure. |
| **Middle Structure** | A transitional level between Swing and Internal structure, often used for refining entries. | Helps to identify strong and weak structure points within a larger trend. |

### 3. The Importance of Context

The examples in this lesson emphasize that no structure point exists in isolation. The validity and importance of a BOS or a specific structure level depend on the **broader market context**.

**Contextual Factors:**
- **Higher Timeframe (HTF) Bias:** Is the BOS aligned with the overall trend on the daily or weekly chart?
- **Liquidity:** Is the BOS a genuine continuation, or is it a move to grab liquidity before a reversal?
- **Supply and Demand:** Is the BOS occurring into a major supply or demand zone?

## Rules and Guidelines

| Rule | Description | Application |
|---|---|---|
| **BOS Confirmation** | A Break of Structure is only valid with a candle **body** close. | Wait for the candle to close before confirming a BOS. Do not act on wicks. |
| **Structure Hierarchy** | Always identify Swing, Internal, and Middle structure. | Map out the different levels of structure on your chart to understand the complete picture. |
| **Context is King** | Analyze the broader market context before making a trading decision. | Check the HTF trend and key liquidity levels before acting on a BOS. |
| **Patience** | Wait for clear confirmation before entering a trade. | Don't jump the gun on a potential BOS. Wait for the market to show its hand. |

## Interconnections with Other Chapters

### Building on Previous Lessons

This lesson is a direct continuation of the previous two lessons:
- **Lesson 3 (Break of Structure):** This lesson provides the practical examples for the theory introduced in Lesson 3.
- **Lesson 4 (Internal vs. Swing Structure):** This lesson shows how to apply the hierarchical model from Lesson 4 to real charts.

### Foundation for Future Lessons

This lesson is a critical building block for the rest of the course:

| Chapter | Connection to this Lesson |
|---|---|
| **Supply and Demand** | Identifying the correct level of structure is essential for selecting the right S&D zones to trade from. |
| **Orderflow** | Understanding the different levels of structure helps to interpret orderflow data more effectively. |
| **Liquidity** | This lesson's examples of wicks vs. bodies are a practical introduction to the concept of liquidity grabs. |
| **Strategies** | All of the strategies in the course rely on a correct interpretation of market structure. |

## Practical Application

### Charting Exercise

1.  Open a chart of your favorite asset on TradingView.
2.  Select a primary timeframe (e.g., 4-hour).
3.  Identify and mark the **Swing Structure** (major highs and lows).
4.  Within one of the swing legs, identify and mark the **Internal Structure**.
5.  Look for examples of both valid (body close) and invalid (wick) Breaks of Structure.
6.  Analyze how the Internal Structure changes before a new Swing Structure point is formed.

### Key Questions to Ask

- Is this a Swing BOS or an Internal BOS?
- Is this BOS aligned with the Higher Timeframe trend?
- Is price breaking structure or just grabbing liquidity?
- What does the change in Internal Structure tell me about the health of the Swing trend?

## Key Takeaways

1.  **Confirmation is key:** A BOS requires a candle body close.
2.  **Structure is hierarchical:** Always be aware of the different levels of structure.
3.  **Context matters:** Analyze the broader market environment before making a decision.
4.  **Practice is essential:** The ability to identify these patterns in real-time comes from practice.

## Connection to The Grand Secret

This lesson provides the first practical glimpse into the "grand secret" of how different levels of structure interact. It shows that the market is not random but a complex, interconnected system. By understanding the relationship between Swing and Internal structure, traders can begin to see the market from the perspective of "smart money" and anticipate major moves before they happen.
