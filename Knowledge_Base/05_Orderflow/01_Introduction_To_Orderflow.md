# Lesson 01: Introduction To Orderflow

This lesson introduces the concept of **Orderflow**—the mechanics of *how* price moves, not just *where* it moves.

## What is Orderflow?

**Orderflow** is the study of the actual buying and selling pressure in the market. While Market Structure tells you the *direction* and Supply/Demand tells you the *location*, Orderflow tells you the *mechanics*—the "engine" that drives price.

## The Two Types of Ranges

The video introduces a fundamental distinction:

| Range Type | Description | Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bearish Range** | A range where the *high* was formed first, followed by the *low*. | The "intent" of this range is bearish. The market created the high to sell into and then drove lower. |
| **Bullish Range** | A range where the *low* was formed first, followed by the *high*. | The "intent" of this range is bullish. The market created the low to buy from and then drove higher. |

## The Core Concept: Order of Events

The "grand secret" of Orderflow is the **Order of Events**. 
- It's not just about *what* happened (a high and a low were formed).
- It's about *which happened first*.

This tells you the **intent** of the market participants who created the range.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Orderflow |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Structure** | Orderflow explains *why* a BOS happens. A BOS is the result of overwhelming buying or selling pressure. |
| **Supply and Demand** | Orderflow explains *how* an S&D zone is created. A strong demand zone is created by aggressive buying that leaves unfilled orders behind. |
| **Risk Management** | Orderflow provides *confirmation* for your entries. If the orderflow aligns with your POI, you can be more confident in your trade. |

## The "Grand Secret" of Orderflow

Orderflow is the "microscope" of trading. It allows you to see the intentions of the market at a level that most traders ignore. By understanding the order of events, you can anticipate the next move *before* the structure confirms it.
