# Lesson 06: Countertrend Trading

This lesson introduces the concept of **Countertrend Trading**—trading against the dominant market structure to capture pullbacks and minor reversals.

## What is Countertrend Trading?

> "We're gonna talk about trading against the trend and how we do that. So like for example, trading against the market structure, trading against the order flow itself."

Countertrend trading is the **opposite** of what we've been learning. Instead of trading *with* the bias, we are trading *against* it to capture the pullback.

## Why Trade Countertrend?

| Reason | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Capture Pullbacks** | In a strong trend, pullbacks can be significant. Countertrend trades allow you to profit from these moves. |
| **Weaker Expansion Legs** | If the trend is showing signs of exhaustion (weak expansion), a countertrend trade can capture the reversal. |
| **More Opportunities** | By trading both with and against the trend, you increase your number of trading opportunities. |

## The Rules for Countertrend Trading

### Rule 1: Use Internal Structure
- Countertrend trades are based on **Internal Structure**, not Swing Structure.
- You are looking for an internal CHoCH *against* the swing bias.

### Rule 2: Target the Next HTF POI
- Your target is the next HTF S&D zone in the direction of your countertrend trade.
- This is typically the zone that caused the last swing leg.

### Rule 3: Manage Risk Aggressively
- Countertrend trades are inherently riskier because you are fighting the dominant trend.
- Use tighter stops and take profits quickly.
- De-risk to break even as soon as possible.

## The "Grand Secret" of Countertrend Trading

The "grand secret" is that **Countertrend Trading is just Internal Structure Trading**. 
- When you trade with the trend, you wait for internal structure to *align* with swing structure.
- When you trade countertrend, you wait for internal structure to *diverge* from swing structure.

The same rules apply; only the direction changes.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Countertrend |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Management** | Countertrend trades require *more aggressive* de-risking because the probability of a reversal is lower. |
| **Market Structure** | Countertrend trades are based on Internal CHoCH *against* the Swing bias. |
| **Supply and Demand** | Your target is the next HTF S&D zone in the countertrend direction. |
