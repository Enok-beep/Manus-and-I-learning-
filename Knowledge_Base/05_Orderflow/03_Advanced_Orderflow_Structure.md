# Lesson 03: Advanced Orderflow/Structure

This lesson takes the RIMC framework and applies it to **Internal Ranges**—the smaller, more precise structures within a larger swing move.

## Understanding Internal Ranges

An **Internal Range** is a smaller consolidation that forms *within* a larger swing move. It is the "fractal" nature of the market at work.

### The Key Insight

> "This looks very overwhelming... but it's actually a lot easier to follow than it appears."

The "grand secret" of this lesson is that **the same rules apply at every level**. Whether you're looking at a Daily swing or a 5-minute internal range, the RIMC framework is the same.

## How to Look at an Internal Range

### Step 1: Identify the Swing Range
- Find the HTF swing high and swing low.
- Determine the bias of the swing range (Bullish or Bearish).

### Step 2: Drop to the LTF
- Inside the swing range, you will see multiple internal ranges.
- Each internal range has its own RIMC cycle.

### Step 3: Align Internal with Swing
- **The Solution**: Only trade internal ranges that are *aligned* with the swing bias.
- If the swing is bullish, look for bullish internal ranges to enter long.
- If the swing is bearish, look for bearish internal ranges to enter short.

## The "Fractal" Connection

| Level | Description | Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Swing Structure** | The "big picture" trend (HTF). | Determines your **Bias**. |
| **Internal Structure** | The "small picture" moves within the swing (LTF). | Determines your **Entry**. |

The connection is that **Internal Structure is the "leading indicator" for Swing Structure**. When internal structure starts to fail (e.g., internal CHoCH against the swing), it is an early warning that the swing may be about to reverse.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Advanced Orderflow |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Structure** | This lesson is the "bridge" between Internal and Swing structure (Lesson 3.04). |
| **Supply and Demand** | The internal range creates internal S&D zones. These are your "sniper" entries. |
| **Risk Management** | By trading internal structure, you can achieve much tighter stop losses and higher RR ratios. |
