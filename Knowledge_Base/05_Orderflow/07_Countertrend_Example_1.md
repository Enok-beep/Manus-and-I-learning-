# Lesson 07: Countertrend Example 1

This lesson provides a **live example** of a countertrend trade, demonstrating the higher-probability approach to trading against the dominant structure.

## The Setup

> "So we're gonna look at an example of the number one, which is obviously the better, higher probability way of going about this into countertrend trading."

The example shows a scenario where:
- The **Swing Structure** is clearly bearish (going down).
- The market has made a **Lower Low** on the 4H timeframe.
- We are looking for a **countertrend long** to capture the pullback.

## The Entry Process (Countertrend)

### Step 1: Identify the Bearish Swing Structure
- Structure went up, making a lower high structure.
- Made a lower low on the four hour.
- This confirms the bearish bias.

### Step 2: Wait for the Internal CHoCH (Bullish)
- Drop to the LTF (e.g., 15m, 5m).
- Look for an internal CHoCH *against* the bearish swing bias.
- This is the signal that the pullback is beginning.

### Step 3: Enter at the Internal S&D Zone
- The bullish CHoCH creates an internal demand zone.
- This is your entry for the countertrend long.

### Step 4: Target the Next HTF Supply Zone
- Your target is the HTF supply zone that caused the last swing leg down.
- This is typically the "Lower High" area.

### Step 5: De-Risk Aggressively
- Move to break even as soon as possible.
- Take partial profits at internal targets.

## The "Grand Secret" of This Example

The "grand secret" is **Probability Selection**. 
- Not all countertrend setups are equal.
- The "number one" (highest probability) setup is when you are trading *into* a clear HTF POI.
- By waiting for the market to reach an extreme, you increase the probability that the countertrend move will be significant.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Example 1 |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Management** | The aggressive de-risking is essential because we are trading against the dominant trend. |
| **Market Structure** | The bearish swing structure tells us the "big picture." The bullish internal CHoCH tells us the pullback is starting. |
| **Supply and Demand** | Our target is the HTF supply zone. Our entry is the LTF demand zone. |
