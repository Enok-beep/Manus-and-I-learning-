# Lesson 05: Getting Into A Trade (Part 2)

This lesson continues the live examples from Part 1, providing additional scenarios and reinforcing the entry process.

## Key Takeaways from Part 2

### Scenario Variations
This lesson shows that the entry process is not always "textbook." The market will present variations, and you need to be adaptable.

### Common Variations:

| Variation | Description | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deep Mitigation** | Price mitigates deeper into the HTF POI than expected. | Be patient. Wait for the LTF CHoCH. Do not enter early. |
| **Shallow Mitigation** | Price barely touches the HTF POI before reversing. | You may miss the entry. Do not chase. Wait for the next opportunity. |
| **Multiple CHoCHs** | The LTF shows multiple CHoCHs before the real move. | Look for the CHoCH that aligns with the HTF structure. The first CHoCH is often a "trap." |

## The "Patience" Principle

The "grand secret" of this lesson is **Patience**. 
- The best trades are the ones where everything aligns perfectly.
- If the setup is not clean, do not force it.
- There will always be another opportunity.

## The Entry Checklist (Refined)

1. [ ] **HTF Bias**: Is the swing structure clear?
2. [ ] **HTF POI**: Is price at a valid S&D zone?
3. [ ] **LTF CHoCH**: Has the LTF confirmed the reversal?
4. [ ] **LTF S&D Zone**: Is there a clear internal zone for entry?
5. [ ] **Risk/Reward**: Is the RR at least 1:2 or better?

If any of these are missing, **do not take the trade**.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Entry P2 |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Management** | Patience is a form of risk management. By waiting for perfect setups, you avoid unnecessary losses. |
| **Market Structure** | The "Multiple CHoCHs" variation teaches you to look for the CHoCH that aligns with the *swing* structure, not just any internal CHoCH. |
| **Supply and Demand** | The "Deep Mitigation" variation shows that S&D zones are *areas*, not exact lines. Be prepared for price to explore the entire zone. |
