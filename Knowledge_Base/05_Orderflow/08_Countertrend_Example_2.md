# Lesson 08: Countertrend Example 2

This lesson provides a second, **riskier** example of a countertrend trade, demonstrating the "number two" approach.

## The Setup

> "So a number two countertrend entry would look something like this. So as you can see, price was making a downtrend, very, very aggressive downtrend. It made a lower high. You confirmed that lower high."

The example shows a scenario where:
- The **Swing Structure** is aggressively bearish.
- The market has confirmed a **Lower High** on the 4H timeframe.
- We are looking for a **countertrend long** based on an early sign of a trend shift.

## The "Riskier" Approach

> "But maybe they were watching for the riskier approach, which was a first sign of a trend shift. Knowing that this is a four hour or higher timeframe, downtrend, that's a risky approach."

### Why is This Riskier?

| Factor | Example 1 (Safer) | Example 2 (Riskier) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Entry Location** | At an HTF extreme (swing low). | Mid-range, after a lower high. |
| **Confirmation** | Strong internal CHoCH. | First sign of a shift (early). |
| **Probability** | Higher. | Lower. |
| **Risk/Reward** | Good. | Potentially better (if it works). |

## The Key Lesson: Risk vs. Reward

The "grand secret" of this lesson is the **Trade-Off**. 
- The "number one" approach (Example 1) is safer but may offer fewer opportunities.
- The "number two" approach (Example 2) is riskier but can catch bigger moves earlier.

**The choice depends on your risk tolerance and trading style.**

## When to Use the "Number Two" Approach

1. **Strong Confluence**: If you have multiple factors aligning (e.g., FVG fill, S&D zone, liquidity sweep), the risk is reduced.
2. **Smaller Position Size**: If you take the riskier trade, reduce your position size to compensate.
3. **Aggressive De-Risking**: Move to break even immediately and take partials quickly.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Example 2 |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Management** | The riskier approach requires *even more aggressive* de-risking and potentially smaller position sizes. |
| **Market Structure** | This approach relies on identifying the *first sign* of a trend shift, which is inherently less reliable than waiting for full confirmation. |
| **Supply and Demand** | Confluence with S&D zones can increase the probability of the riskier approach. |
