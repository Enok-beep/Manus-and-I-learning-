# Lesson 02: Range, Initiation, Mitigation, Continuation (RIMC)

This lesson introduces the **RIMC Framework**—a systematic way to understand the lifecycle of a price move.

## The RIMC Framework

**RIMC** stands for:
1. **Range**: The consolidation phase where price builds up energy.
2. **Initiation**: The impulsive move that breaks out of the range.
3. **Mitigation**: The pullback to "mitigate" the orders left behind in the range.
4. **Continuation**: The next leg of the move in the direction of the initiation.

## Breaking Down Each Phase

### 1. Range
- A range is formed when price creates a swing high and a swing low.
- The **order of events** (which came first) determines the bias of the range.
- A **Bearish Range** has the high formed first, then the low.
- A **Bullish Range** has the low formed first, then the high.

### 2. Initiation
- The initiation is the **Break of Structure (BOS)** that confirms the direction.
- This is the "intent" of the market being expressed.
- The initiation leg often leaves behind an **FVG** (Fair Value Gap) and creates an **S&D zone**.

### 3. Mitigation
- Price rarely moves in a straight line. It needs to "mitigate" the orders left behind.
- The mitigation is the pullback into the range or the S&D zone created by the initiation.
- This is where you look for your **entry**.

### 4. Continuation
- After mitigating, price continues in the direction of the initiation.
- This is where you take **profit**.

## The "Grand Secret" of RIMC

The RIMC framework is the **"Heartbeat" of the market**. Every move, on every timeframe, follows this cycle:
1. Build up (Range)
2. Break out (Initiation)
3. Pull back (Mitigation)
4. Continue (Continuation)

By identifying which phase the market is currently in, you can anticipate the next phase and position yourself accordingly.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to RIMC |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Structure** | The "Initiation" is the BOS. The "Range" is the consolidation before the BOS. |
| **Supply and Demand** | The "Mitigation" is the return to the S&D zone created by the initiation. |
| **Risk Management** | The RIMC framework tells you *when* to enter (Mitigation) and *when* to exit (Continuation). |
