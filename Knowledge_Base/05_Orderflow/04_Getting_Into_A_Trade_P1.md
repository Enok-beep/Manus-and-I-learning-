# Lesson 04: Getting Into A Trade (Part 1)

This lesson provides **live examples** of using the Orderflow concepts to find actual trade entries.

## The Purpose of This Lesson

> "This is some live examples of using the order flow that we just discussed... to actually find an entry using it for confirmation on the entry itself, using it to figure out the target, et cetera."

This is the "rubber meets the road" lesson. We are taking all the theory and applying it to real charts.

## The Entry Process

### Step 1: Identify the HTF Bias
- What is the swing structure telling you?
- Are we in a bullish or bearish environment?

### Step 2: Wait for Price to Reach a POI
- Use the Supply and Demand rules to identify your HTF POI.
- Be patient. Do not chase price.

### Step 3: Drop to the LTF and Look for Confirmation
- Once price enters your HTF POI, drop to the LTF (e.g., 15m, 5m, 1m).
- Look for an **Internal CHoCH** (Change of Character) in the direction of your bias.

### Step 4: Find the LTF Entry Zone
- The CHoCH will create an internal S&D zone.
- This is your **Entry Zone**.

### Step 5: Execute the Trade
- Place your entry at the internal S&D zone.
- Place your stop loss below/above the zone.
- Place your target at the next HTF structural point.

## The "Grand Secret" of Entry

The "grand secret" is **Confirmation**. 
- You never enter blindly at an HTF POI.
- You always wait for the LTF to *confirm* that the POI is holding.
- The confirmation is the **Internal CHoCH**.

This is what separates professional traders from gamblers. Gamblers enter at a zone and "hope" it holds. Professionals wait for the market to *tell them* it's holding.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Entry |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Management** | The internal S&D zone allows for a very tight stop loss, maximizing your RR. |
| **Market Structure** | The HTF bias tells you *which direction* to trade. The LTF CHoCH tells you *when* to enter. |
| **Supply and Demand** | The HTF POI is your "area of interest." The LTF S&D zone is your "sniper entry." |
| **Orderflow (RIMC)** | The entry happens during the "Mitigation" phase of the RIMC cycle. |
