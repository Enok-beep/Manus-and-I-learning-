# Lesson 08: S2D Flip Example

This lesson (10:18) provides a **real chart example** of a Supply to Demand (S2D) Flip in action.

## Core Concept: S2D Flip in Practice

From the transcript:
> "Alright guys, so now we'll find an example of a supply to demand flip. Let's see where we are in relation to price action."

> "So this is actually fairly recent price action relative to today's date, which is the 29th of June, 2023. For myself, we are looking at structure. This is all internal structure."

> "Clearly structure is between a point as such as this and this. We're trading in between those two points. Currently,"

> "overall structure at the time is looking like it is pointing up very aggressively, but that's okay."

## The Example Setup

### Initial Observation:
- **Recent price action** (June 29, 2023).
- **Internal structure** is the focus.
- **Structure is between two points** (range-bound).
- **Overall structure is pointing up aggressively**.

### The Key Insight:
> **Even in an aggressive uptrend, S2D flips provide precision entries.**
> - The trend provides the direction.
> - The flip provides the entry.

## The "Black and White" Rules for S2D Flip

### Step 1: Identify the Supply Zone
> **Find a zone where price previously dropped from.**
> - This is the original Supply zone.
> - It should have caused a significant reaction.

### Step 2: Wait for the Break
> **Price must break above the Supply zone with a Body Close.**
> - This confirms the shift from bearish to bullish sentiment.
> - The break should be impulsive.

### Step 3: Wait for the Return
> **Price must return to the broken Supply zone.**
> - This is the "flip" in action.
> - The zone now acts as Demand.

### Step 4: Enter Long
> **Enter long on confirmation at the flipped zone.**
> - Look for a rejection candle.
> - Or a CHoCH on the LTF.

### Step 5: Manage the Trade
> **Stop Loss**: Below the flipped zone.
> **Take Profit**: Next structural target (e.g., the high of the range or extension).

## Visual Representation

### S2D Flip Example:
```
    LOW OF RANGE
         │
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │ SUPPLY  │ <-- Original Supply Zone (price dropped from here)
    └────┬────┘
         │
         ▲ (Price breaks above Supply)
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │ DEMAND  │ <-- Zone flips to Demand
    └────┬────┘
         │
         ▼ (Price returns to zone)
         │
    [ENTRY LONG]
         │
         ▲
         │
    HIGH OF RANGE <-- Target
```

## The Aggressive Uptrend Context

From the transcript, Jayson notes that **"overall structure at the time is looking like it is pointing up very aggressively."** This is important because:

| Aggressive Uptrend | Ranging Market |
| :--- | :--- |
| S2D flips are pullback entries | S2D flips are reversal entries |
| Targets are extensions | Targets are range extremes |
| Higher probability | Moderate probability |

### The Key Insight:
> **In an aggressive uptrend, S2D flips are the "Smart Money" way to enter.**
> - You are buying the pullback.
> - You are buying at a zone that has proven itself.
> - You are buying with the trend.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to S2D Flip |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Supply and Demand** | The foundation of the flip |
| **Market Structure** | The aggressive uptrend context |
| **Internal Structure** | The focus of this example |
| **Risk Management** | Stop loss below the zone |
| **Premium/Discount** | Buy in Discount (at the flipped Demand) |

## Practical Checklist for S2D Flip

### Before Entry:
- [ ] Identify the original Supply zone.
- [ ] Confirm the break above the zone (Body Close).
- [ ] Wait for price to return to the zone.
- [ ] Look for LTF confirmation (rejection or CHoCH).

### At Entry:
- [ ] Enter long at the flipped zone.
- [ ] Set stop loss below the zone.
- [ ] Set take profit at the next structural target.

### After Entry:
- [ ] Move to break even after TP1.
- [ ] Trail stop behind structural points.
- [ ] Take partials at each target.

## S2D vs. D2S Comparison

| S2D Flip (Bullish) | D2S Flip (Bearish) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Supply zone breaks up | Demand zone breaks down |
| Zone flips to Demand | Zone flips to Supply |
| Enter long on return | Enter short on return |
| Stop below zone | Stop above zone |
| Target: Higher highs | Target: Lower lows |

## The "Grand Secret" of S2D Flips

> **S2D Flips are the "Smart Money" long entry model.**
> - Smart Money accumulates at Demand zones.
> - When they are ready to move price up, they **break** the opposing Supply zone.
> - They then **return** to the broken zone to fill any remaining long orders.
> - This is your opportunity to enter **with** Smart Money.

### Why This Works:
1. **The zone has proven itself** by causing a drop.
2. **The break confirms intent** to move up.
3. **The return is the "last chance"** to get long.
4. **Smart Money is defending the zone** on the return.
