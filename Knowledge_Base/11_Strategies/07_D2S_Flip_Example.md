# Lesson 07: D2S Flip Example

This lesson (09:37) provides a **real chart example** of a Demand to Supply (D2S) Flip in action.

## Core Concept: D2S Flip in Practice

From the transcript:
> "Let's see if we can find ourselves a nice supply to demand flip or demand to supply Flip. Let's take a look."

> "So what's going on with price? Well, clearly price is trending up here. Ultimately we should be taking a look at the 15 minute chart to see what exactly"

> "is going on. Unfortunately, it seems like I picked an area that is a range bound environment between this high and this low down here. However,"

> "we will discount price action all the way over here..."

## The Example Setup

### Initial Observation:
- **Price is trending up** on the higher timeframe.
- **15-minute chart** is used for detailed analysis.
- **Range-bound environment** identified between a high and a low.

### The Key Insight:
> **Even in a range, D2S/S2D flips can be traded.**
> - The range provides the boundaries.
> - The flip provides the entry.

## The "Black and White" Rules for D2S Flip

### Step 1: Identify the Demand Zone
> **Find a zone where price previously rallied from.**
> - This is the original Demand zone.
> - It should have caused a significant reaction.

### Step 2: Wait for the Break
> **Price must break below the Demand zone with a Body Close.**
> - This confirms the shift from bullish to bearish sentiment.
> - The break should be impulsive.

### Step 3: Wait for the Return
> **Price must return to the broken Demand zone.**
> - This is the "flip" in action.
> - The zone now acts as Supply.

### Step 4: Enter Short
> **Enter short on confirmation at the flipped zone.**
> - Look for a rejection candle.
> - Or a CHoCH on the LTF.

### Step 5: Manage the Trade
> **Stop Loss**: Above the flipped zone.
> **Take Profit**: Next structural target (e.g., the low of the range).

## Visual Representation

### D2S Flip Example:
```
    HIGH OF RANGE
         │
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │ DEMAND  │ <-- Original Demand Zone (price rallied from here)
    └────┬────┘
         │
         ▼ (Price breaks below Demand)
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │ SUPPLY  │ <-- Zone flips to Supply
    └────┬────┘
         │
         ▲ (Price returns to zone)
         │
    [ENTRY SHORT]
         │
         ▼
         │
    LOW OF RANGE <-- Target
```

## The Range-Bound Environment

From the transcript, Jayson identifies a **range-bound environment**. This is important because:

| Range Trading | Trend Trading |
| :--- | :--- |
| Trade from range extremes | Trade with the trend |
| D2S/S2D flips at range boundaries | D2S/S2D flips as pullback entries |
| Targets are the opposite range extreme | Targets are structural extensions |

### The Key Insight:
> **In a range, D2S/S2D flips are even more powerful.**
> - The range provides clear boundaries.
> - The flip provides the entry.
> - The opposite extreme provides the target.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to D2S Flip |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Supply and Demand** | The foundation of the flip |
| **Ranges** | The context for this example |
| **Market Structure** | The break confirms the structural shift |
| **Risk Management** | Stop loss above the zone |
| **Premium/Discount** | Sell in Premium (at the flipped Supply) |

## Practical Checklist for D2S Flip

### Before Entry:
- [ ] Identify the original Demand zone.
- [ ] Confirm the break below the zone (Body Close).
- [ ] Wait for price to return to the zone.
- [ ] Look for LTF confirmation (rejection or CHoCH).

### At Entry:
- [ ] Enter short at the flipped zone.
- [ ] Set stop loss above the zone.
- [ ] Set take profit at the next structural target.

### After Entry:
- [ ] Move to break even after TP1.
- [ ] Trail stop behind structural points.
- [ ] Take partials at each target.

## The "Grand Secret" of D2S Flips

> **D2S Flips are the "Smart Money" short entry model.**
> - Smart Money distributes at Supply zones.
> - When they are ready to move price down, they **break** the opposing Demand zone.
> - They then **return** to the broken zone to fill any remaining short orders.
> - This is your opportunity to enter **with** Smart Money.

### Why This Works:
1. **The zone has proven itself** by causing a rally.
2. **The break confirms intent** to move down.
3. **The return is the "last chance"** to get short.
4. **Smart Money is defending the zone** on the return.
