# Lesson 15: S2D/D2S Example 8

This lesson (06:36) provides the **final example** of Supply to Demand and Demand to Supply flips, with a focus on **"cheating"** and the importance of **candle structure**.

## Core Concept: The "Cheating" Rule

From the transcript:
> "We will cover some more of this. But before we do, we will actually look at one more example here and it's actually gonna relate to"

> "what we just talked about with the structure. So clearly we have a low that was put in here. I'm not gonna use that wick and then up again 'cause that's one candle."

> "I can't do that. It's cheating. We have this lower high, we had a sweep it a low, we had a change of structure."

> "Taking the low close above the high. All is fine. All is well. Do you have any evidence of supply"

## The Key Insight: No "Cheating"

This lesson teaches the concept of **honest analysis** and avoiding shortcuts.

### What is "Cheating"?
> **Cheating** = Using invalid structural points to justify a trade.
> - Using a wick as a structural point when it's part of the same candle.
> - Ignoring the rules to force a trade.
> - Seeing what you want to see, not what's there.

### Why "Cheating" is Dangerous:
> "I can't do that. It's cheating."
> - Cheating leads to false signals.
> - False signals lead to losses.
> - Losses lead to emotional trading.
> - Emotional trading leads to more losses.

## The Example Analysis

### The Setup
From the transcript:
> "So clearly we have a low that was put in here. I'm not gonna use that wick and then up again 'cause that's one candle."

| Element | Observation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Low | Clearly defined |
| Wick | Part of the same candle |
| Rule | Can't use the wick as a separate point |

### The Valid Structure
From the transcript:
> "We have this lower high, we had a sweep it a low, we had a change of structure."

| Element | Observation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Lower High | Valid structural point |
| Sweep | Liquidity taken |
| CHoCH | Change of structure confirmed |

### The Confirmation
From the transcript:
> "Taking the low close above the high. All is fine. All is well."

| Element | Observation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Close | Above the high |
| Status | "All is fine. All is well." |
| Verdict | Valid flip setup |

## The "Black and White" Rules (Honesty Edition)

### What is "Cheating"?
1. **Using a wick as a structural point** when it's part of the same candle.
2. **Ignoring the body close rule** to force a trade.
3. **Using overlapping candles** as separate structural points.
4. **Seeing patterns that aren't there** to justify a trade.

### What is "Honest Analysis"?
1. **Using only valid structural points** (separate candles).
2. **Requiring body closes** for all confirmations.
3. **Accepting when a setup is invalid** and moving on.
4. **Seeing what's there**, not what you want to see.

    │                                    │   ▼ (VALID)
```

## The "Sweep" Concept

From the transcript:
> "we had a sweep it a low"

### What is a "Sweep"?
> **Sweep** = Price briefly breaks a level to take liquidity, then reverses.
> - The sweep "sweeps" the stop losses below the low.
> - This provides fuel for the reversal.
> - A sweep is a sign of manipulation.

### How to Identify a Sweep:
1. **Price breaks a key level** (low or high).
2. **Price quickly reverses** (within 1-3 candles).
3. **The break is a wick**, not a body close.
4. **The reversal is strong** (impulsive move).

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Role in This Lesson |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Structure** | The structural points |
| **Liquidity** | The sweep concept |
| **Supply and Demand** | The flip setup |
| **Risk Management** | Avoiding false signals |

## Practical Checklist for "Honest" Analysis

### Before Entry:
- [ ] Are all structural points from SEPARATE candles?
- [ ] Is the body close rule satisfied?
- [ ] Is the sweep clearly visible?
- [ ] Is the change of structure confirmed?
- [ ] Am I seeing what's there, or what I want to see?

### If ALL Answers are "Yes":
> **This is an "honest" setup.**
> - Enter with confidence.
> - Manage the trade according to Risk Management rules.

### If ANY Answer is "No":
> **This is a "cheating" setup.**
> - Skip the trade.
> - Wait for a valid opportunity.

## The "Grand Secret" of This Lesson

> **The best traders are the ones who are HONEST with themselves.**
> - They don't "cheat" to force trades.
> - They accept when a setup is invalid.
> - They wait for valid opportunities.

### The Key Insight:
> **"I can't do that. It's cheating."**
> - Jayson is teaching us to be disciplined.
> - Discipline is the key to long-term success.
> - "Cheating" leads to short-term gains but long-term losses.
