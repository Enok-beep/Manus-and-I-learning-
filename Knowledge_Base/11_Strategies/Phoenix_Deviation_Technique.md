# Phoenix Deviation Technique (Range Deviation Strategy)

The Phoenix Deviation Technique is a high-probability trading strategy that revolves around the concept of **Market Structure** and **Range Deviation**. It is designed to capitalize on false breakouts (deviations) from established trading ranges.

## Core Concept

The strategy operates on the principle that institutional players often manipulate price to sweep liquidity outside of a perceived trading range before reversing the price back into the range. This "deviation" or "false breakout" provides a high-probability entry point for a trade in the opposite direction.

## Key Components

| Component | Description | Relevance to Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trading Range** | A clearly defined area of consolidation between a swing high and a swing low. | Defines the boundaries for the deviation. |
| **Deviation** | A price move that temporarily breaks above the high or below the low of the trading range. | The primary signal for a potential entry. |
| **Market Structure** | The overall trend and context of the market (e.g., bullish or bearish). | Provides the directional bias for the trade. |
| **Liquidity Sweep** | The deviation must be a clear sweep of stop-losses placed outside the range. | Confirms the institutional nature of the move. |
