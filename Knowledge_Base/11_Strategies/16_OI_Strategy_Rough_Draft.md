# Lesson 16: OI Strategy – Rough Draft (Livestream)

This lesson (55:19) is a **recorded livestream** where Jayson introduces a new, experimental strategy based on **Open Interest (OI)**.

## Core Concept: Open Interest as a Trading Tool

From the transcript:
> "Word button on OVS so we can actually like record it. I figured I was just gonna make a video and upload it."

> "Why would I do that when I can just do it this way? Screw it. Um, alright, let's go to here."

> "Okay, I'm opening my screen. Alright, so I'm gonna open my, my, uh, my screen here. So essentially I've been dabbling"

> "with open interest, okay? One of my good friends has, uh, you know, he is been showing me some things with open interest."

## What is Open Interest (OI)?

> **Open Interest** = The total number of outstanding derivative contracts (futures, options) that have not been settled.
> - **Increasing OI** = New money entering the market (new positions being opened).
> - **Decreasing OI** = Money leaving the market (positions being closed).

### Why OI Matters:
> "essentially I've been dabbling with open interest, okay? One of my good friends has, uh, you know, he is been showing me some things with open interest."
> - OI provides insight into **market participation**.
> - It shows whether a move is supported by **new money** or just **existing positions**.
> - This is a **leading indicator** for potential reversals.

## The "Rough Draft" Nature

This lesson is explicitly labeled as a "Rough Draft," meaning:
1. **The strategy is experimental** and not fully tested.
2. **Jayson is learning** from a friend and sharing his exploration.
3. **The rules may change** as more backtesting is done.
4. **Use with caution** and do your own research.

## Key OI Concepts

### OI + Price Relationship:
| OI Change | Price Change | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| OI Increasing | Price Increasing | **Strong Bullish** – New longs entering |
| OI Increasing | Price Decreasing | **Strong Bearish** – New shorts entering |
| OI Decreasing | Price Increasing | **Weak Bullish** – Shorts covering |
| OI Decreasing | Price Decreasing | **Weak Bearish** – Longs closing |

### The Key Insight:
> **"Strong" moves** are supported by increasing OI.
> **"Weak" moves** are just position closing.

## How OI Integrates with the Course

### Connection to Previous Chapters:
| Concept | OI Integration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Structure** | OI confirms structural breaks |
| **Supply and Demand** | OI shows zone strength |
| **Liquidity** | OI reveals where liquidity is building |
| **Wyckoff** | OI confirms accumulation/distribution |

### The "Grand Secret" Connection:
> OI is another layer of **confirmation**.
> - It doesn't replace the existing system.
> - It adds **depth** to the analysis.
> - It helps distinguish between **real moves** and **fakeouts**.

## Practical Application (Rough Draft)

### The Basic OI Strategy:
1. **Identify a key level** (S&D zone, structural point).
2. **Check OI at the level**:
   - If OI is increasing → Strong reaction expected.
   - If OI is decreasing → Weak reaction expected.
3. **Combine with existing analysis**:
   - Use Market Structure for direction.
   - Use S&D for entry.
   - Use OI for confirmation.

### Warning:
> **This is a rough draft strategy.**
> - Do not trade this blindly.
> - Backtest extensively before using.
> - Combine with the core course concepts.

## Tools for OI Analysis

### Recommended Platforms:
1. **Coinglass** – For crypto OI data.
2. **TradingView** – With OI indicators.
3. **Exchange APIs** – For real-time data.

### Key Metrics:
- **Total OI** – Overall market participation.
- **OI Delta** – Change in OI over time.
- **Funding Rate** – Cost of holding positions.

## The "Dabbling" Mindset

From the transcript:
> "So essentially I've been dabbling with open interest"

### What "Dabbling" Means:
> Jayson is exploring new concepts and sharing his journey.
> - He's not claiming to be an expert.
> - He's showing the process of learning.
> - This is how traders evolve.

### The Lesson for Us:
> **Never stop learning.**
> - The market evolves, and so should you.
> - Be open to new tools and concepts.
> - But always validate before trading.

## Connection to the "Grand Secret"

### The Ultimate Interconnection:
> OI is the **"fuel gauge"** of the market.
> - Market Structure tells you the direction.
> - S&D tells you the destination.
> - Liquidity tells you the magnets.
> - OI tells you how much **fuel** is behind the move.

### The Key Insight:
> **A move without OI support is a move without conviction.**
> - High OI + Price move = Real move.
> - Low OI + Price move = Potential fakeout.

## Practical Checklist for OI Integration

### Before Entry:
- [ ] Is the Market Structure aligned?
- [ ] Is there a valid S&D zone?
- [ ] Is OI increasing or decreasing?
- [ ] Does OI support the expected move?

### If ALL Answers Support the Trade:
> **This is a high-conviction setup.**
> - Enter with confidence.
> - Manage according to Risk Management rules.

### If OI Contradicts the Setup:
> **This is a low-conviction setup.**
> - Consider reducing position size.
> - Be more aggressive with de-risking.
> - Or skip the trade entirely.

## Summary

This lesson introduces **Open Interest** as a new tool for market analysis. While still a "rough draft," it shows how OI can add another layer of confirmation to the existing system.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **OI shows market participation** – New money vs. closing positions.
2. **OI confirms moves** – Strong moves have OI support.
3. **OI is a tool, not a system** – Use it to enhance, not replace.
4. **Keep learning** – The market evolves, and so should you.
