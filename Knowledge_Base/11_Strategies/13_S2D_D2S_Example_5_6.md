# Lesson 13: S2D/D2S Example 5/6

This lesson (08:43) provides **two more practical examples** of Supply to Demand and Demand to Supply flips, with a focus on finding **"juicy" setups**.

## Core Concept: Finding Quality Setups

From the transcript:
> "Let's see if we can find some more while we're at it, right? We're on a roll here. Now again, there's probably many of them that I missed."

> "Okay? I'm just looking for ones that look decent to explain. Obviously I'm not looking for every single one known to mankind here."

> "I wanna find something juicy for you guys. This may have been one and the entry actually may have been missed."

> "We're gonna find out here in just a second. So let's go back with the replay to where that entry would've been."

## The Key Insight: "Juicy" Setups

This lesson teaches the concept of **quality over quantity** in flip trading.

### What Makes a Setup "Juicy"?
> **Juicy** = High-probability, high-reward, low-risk.
> - Clear zone definition.
> - Clean break and return.
> - Multiple confluences.
> - Good Risk/Reward ratio.

### Why Focus on "Juicy" Setups?
> "I'm just looking for ones that look decent to explain. Obviously I'm not looking for every single one known to mankind here."
> - Not every flip is worth trading.
> - Focus on the best setups.
> - Quality over quantity.

## The Example Analysis

### Example 5: The "Missed Entry"
From the transcript:
> "This may have been one and the entry actually may have been missed."

| Element | Observation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Zone | Valid flip zone |
| Entry | May have been missed |
| Lesson | Even good setups can be missed |

### Example 6: The "Replay Analysis"
From the transcript:
> "We're gonna find out here in just a second. So let's go back with the replay to where that entry would've been."

| Element | Observation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Method | Replay analysis |
| Purpose | Identify the exact entry point |
| Lesson | Use replay to study setups |

## The "Black and White" Rules (Quality Edition)

### "Juicy" Setup Criteria:
1. **Zone is clearly defined** (no ambiguity).
2. **Break is clean** (body close, not wick).
3. **Return is precise** (to the zone, not near it).
4. **Confluences are present** (structure, liquidity, etc.).
5. **Risk/Reward is favorable** (at least 2:1).

### "Not Juicy" Indicators:
1. **Zone is unclear** (overlapping, messy).
2. **Break is messy** (wicks, no body close).
3. **Return is imprecise** (near the zone, not to it).
4. **No confluences** (flip alone).
5. **Risk/Reward is poor** (less than 2:1).

## Visual Representation

### "Juicy" vs. "Not Juicy" Flip:
```
"JUICY" FLIP:                        "NOT JUICY" FLIP:
                                     
    ┌─────────┐                          ┌─────────┐
    │  ZONE   │ <-- Clear                │  ZONE?  │ <-- Unclear
    └────┬────┘                          └────┬────┘
         │                                    │
         ▼ (Clean break)                      ▼ (Messy break)
         │                                    │
         ▲ (Precise return)                   ▲ (Imprecise return)
         │                                    │
    ┌────┴────┐                          ┌────┴────┐
    │  FLIP   │ <-- Multiple             │  FLIP   │ <-- No
    │         │    confluences           │         │    confluences
    └────┬────┘                          └────┬────┘
         │                                    │
    [ENTRY] ✓                            [SKIP] ✗
    RR: 3:1                              RR: 1:1
```

## The Importance of Replay Analysis

From the transcript:
> "So let's go back with the replay to where that entry would've been."

### Why Use Replay?
> **Replay** = Going back in time to study a setup.
> - See the setup as it developed in real-time.
> - Identify the exact entry point.
> - Learn from missed opportunities.

### How to Use Replay:
1. **Identify a potential flip** on the chart.
2. **Go back in time** to when the flip was forming.
3. **Watch the price action** as it develops.
4. **Identify the entry point** (where you would have entered).
5. **Evaluate the outcome** (did the trade work?).

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Role in This Lesson |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Supply and Demand** | The foundation of the flip |
| **Market Structure** | Provides confluences |
| **Risk Management** | Evaluates Risk/Reward |
| **Practice** | Replay analysis |

## Practical Checklist for Finding "Juicy" Setups

### Before Entry:
- [ ] Is the zone clearly defined?
- [ ] Is the break clean (body close)?
- [ ] Is the return precise (to the zone)?
- [ ] Are there multiple confluences?
- [ ] Is the Risk/Reward favorable (at least 2:1)?

### If ALL Answers are "Yes":
> **This is a "juicy" setup.**
> - Enter with confidence.
> - Manage the trade according to Risk Management rules.

### If ANY Answer is "No":
> **This is NOT a "juicy" setup.**
> - Skip the trade.
> - Wait for a better opportunity.

## The "Grand Secret" of This Lesson

> **The best traders are the ones who wait for "juicy" setups.**
> - They don't trade every flip.
> - They wait for the best opportunities.
> - They maximize their Risk/Reward.

### The Key Insight:
> **"I wanna find something juicy for you guys."**
> - Jayson is teaching us to be selective.
> - Not every flip is worth trading.
> - Focus on quality, not quantity.
