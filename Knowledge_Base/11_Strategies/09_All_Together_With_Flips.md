# Lesson 09: All Together With Flips

This lesson (14:08) provides a **live example** of how to combine all the concepts learned so far into a complete trading approach.

## Core Concept: Putting It All Together

From the transcript:
> "Alright, so we're gonna take a look at a live example of how to go about scalping using the transition and structure, using market structure as a whole,"

> "using supply and demand, using flips, putting everything together to figure out how we can develop a scalp trade. And this is actually dated Thursday, July 6th."

> "I am on borough play slightly here just so we have an example to go with. So let's go ahead and determine what has happened before we even try"

## The Complete Trading Framework

This lesson synthesizes **everything** we've learned into a single, cohesive trading approach:

### The Components:
1. **Market Structure** - The direction and context.
2. **Supply and Demand** - The zones of interest.
3. **S2D/D2S Flips** - The high-probability entry model.
4. **Scalping** - The execution style.

## The "Black and White" Rules for Putting It All Together

### Step 1: Determine Market Structure
> **Start with the HTF to determine the overall bias.**
> - Is the market bullish, bearish, or ranging?
> - Where are the key structural points?

### Step 2: Identify Key Zones
> **Mark the relevant Supply and Demand zones.**
> - Where are the zones that have caused reactions?
> - Which zones are in Premium (for shorts) or Discount (for longs)?

### Step 3: Look for Flips
> **Wait for a zone to be broken and price to return.**
> - S2D for bullish entries.
> - D2S for bearish entries.

### Step 4: Execute the Scalp
> **Enter on LTF confirmation at the flipped zone.**
> - Use a tight stop loss.
> - Target the next structural level.

### Step 5: Manage the Trade
> **Follow the Risk Management rules.**
> - Move to break even after TP1.
> - Trail stop behind structural points.

## The Scalping Approach

### What is Scalping?
> **Scalping is a trading style that focuses on small, quick profits.**
> - Short holding times.
> - Tight stop losses.
> - High frequency of trades.

### How Flips Enhance Scalping:
| Traditional Scalping | Flip-Based Scalping |
| :--- | :--- |
| Random entries | Structured entries |
| Wide stops | Tight stops |
| Low probability | High probability |
| Emotional | Systematic |

### The Key Insight:
> **Flips provide the precision that scalping requires.**
> - You know exactly where to enter.
> - You know exactly where to place your stop.
> - You know exactly where to take profit.

## Practical Checklist for "All Together"

### Pre-Trade Analysis:
- [ ] Determine HTF bias (bullish, bearish, ranging).
- [ ] Identify key structural points (HH, HL, LH, LL).
- [ ] Mark relevant S&D zones.
- [ ] Identify potential flip zones.

### Trade Setup:
- [ ] Wait for a zone to be broken.
- [ ] Wait for price to return to the broken zone.
- [ ] Look for LTF confirmation.

### Trade Execution:
- [ ] Enter at the flipped zone.
- [ ] Set stop loss beyond the zone.
- [ ] Set take profit at the next structural target.

### Trade Management:
- [ ] Move to break even after TP1.
- [ ] Trail stop behind structural points.
- [ ] Take partials at each target.

## The "Grand Secret" of This Lesson

> **The "grand secret" is that all the concepts are interconnected.**
> - Market Structure provides the **context**.
> - Supply and Demand provides the **location**.
> - Flips provide the **entry**.
> - Risk Management provides the **survival**.

### The Complete Picture:
1. **Know the trend** (Market Structure).
2. **Know the zones** (Supply and Demand).
3. **Know the entry** (S2D/D2S Flips).
4. **Know the risk** (Risk Management).

> **When all four align, you have a high-probability trade.**
