# Lesson 13: Backtesting Wyckoff Models

This lesson (33:30) provides a **practical guide to backtesting** Wyckoff models using TradingView's bar replay tool.

## Core Concept: The Importance of Practice

> "We're gonna talk about ways that we can practice yco. 'cause this is essential to learning. You need to learn how to practice these things. So what I'm doing is I'm just taking my bar replay tool off. I'm looking at wherever price action is. I'm going to a higher timeframe. I'll start on the daily. Okay, on the daily I'm gonna look at my market structure points. I can either A, envision these points both from swing internal and fractal standpoints, or B, I can just look at highs and look at lows and go from there."

## The Backtesting Framework

### Step 1: Choose Your Timeframe
- Start on the **Daily** timeframe for HTF context.
- Use the **Bar Replay** tool in TradingView.

### Step 2: Identify Market Structure
- Mark **Swing Highs and Lows**.
- Identify the **Overall Bias** (Bullish, Bearish, or Ranging).

### Step 3: Look for Wyckoff Patterns
- Identify potential **Accumulation** or **Distribution** ranges.
- Mark the **Phases** (A, B, C, D, E).

### Step 4: Zoom In for Entries
- Drop to a **Lower Timeframe** (4H, 1H, 15m).
- Look for **LTF Wyckoff patterns** within the HTF phases.
- Identify **Entry Points** (Spring, UTAD, LPS, LPSY).

### Step 5: Execute and Record
- Execute the trade on the bar replay.
- Record the **Entry, Stop Loss, and Take Profit**.
- Calculate the **Risk/Reward** ratio.

## The Two Approaches to Backtesting

### Approach A: Swing and Internal Structure
- Mark **Swing Structure** on the HTF.
- Mark **Internal Structure** on the LTF.
- Look for alignment between the two.

### Approach B: Simple Highs and Lows
- Just mark the **Highs and Lows** on the chart.
- Look for **Ranges** that form between them.
- Identify **Wyckoff Patterns** within those ranges.

## What to Look For During Backtesting

| Element | What to Identify |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Range** | Clear consolidation with defined high and low |
| **Spring/UTAD** | False breakout (liquidity grab) |
| **SOS/SOW** | Confirmation of direction |
| **LPS/LPSY** | Pullback entry after confirmation |
| **BOS** | Break of structure (final confirmation) |

## Recording Your Backtests

### Key Metrics to Track:
1. **Win Rate**: Percentage of winning trades.
2. **Average R:R**: Average Risk/Reward ratio.
3. **Expectancy**: (Win Rate × Avg Win) - (Loss Rate × Avg Loss).
4. **Max Drawdown**: Largest losing streak.

### Sample Backtest Journal:

| Date | Asset | Model | Entry | SL | TP | R:R | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2024-01-01 | BTC | Acc M1 | Spring | -1R | +3R | 3:1 | Win |
| 2024-01-05 | ETH | Dist M2 | LPSY | -1R | +2R | 2:1 | Win |
| 2024-01-10 | BTC | Reacc | LPS | -1R | +2.5R | 2.5:1 | Loss |

## Common Backtesting Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Hindsight Bias
- **Problem**: Seeing patterns that weren't obvious in real-time.
- **Solution**: Use the bar replay tool to simulate real-time trading.

### Mistake 2: Cherry-Picking
- **Problem**: Only backtesting winning trades.
- **Solution**: Backtest **every** potential setup, including losses.

### Mistake 3: Not Tracking Metrics
- **Problem**: Not knowing your actual win rate or expectancy.
- **Solution**: Keep a detailed journal of every backtest.

## The "Black and White" Rules for Backtesting

### Rule 1: Use Bar Replay
- Always use the bar replay tool to simulate real-time trading.
- Never backtest with the full chart visible.

### Rule 2: Follow Your Rules
- Apply the **same rules** you would use in live trading.
- Don't make exceptions "just this once."

### Rule 3: Track Everything
- Record every trade, including losses.
- Calculate your metrics after each session.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Backtesting |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Management** | Track R:R and position sizing |
| **Market Structure** | Identify HTF and LTF structure |
| **Supply and Demand** | Mark S&D zones for entries |
| **Liquidity** | Identify liquidity grabs |
| **Ranges** | Identify Wyckoff ranges |
| **Wyckoff** | Apply all models |

## The "Grand Secret" of Backtesting

> **Backtesting is the bridge between theory and reality.**
> - It transforms **knowledge** into **skill**.
> - It builds the **muscle memory** needed for live trading.
> - It reveals the **true edge** of your strategy.

## The "Ultimate Interconnection"

> **Backtesting connects everything in this course.**
> - It forces you to apply **Risk Management** (position sizing).
> - It requires you to read **Market Structure** (bias).
> - It demands you identify **Supply and Demand** (entries).
> - It tests your understanding of **Wyckoff** (patterns).
> - It is the **final exam** of the course.
