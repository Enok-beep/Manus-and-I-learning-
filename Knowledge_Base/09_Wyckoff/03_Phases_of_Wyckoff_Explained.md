# Lesson 03: Phases of Wyckoff Explained

This lesson (20:11) provides a **detailed breakdown of the five phases** of Wyckoff accumulation and distribution schematics.

## Core Concept: The Five Phases

The Wyckoff schematic is divided into **five distinct phases**: A, B, C, D, and E. Each phase has a specific purpose and set of events that must occur before moving to the next phase.

## Visual Reference: Accumulation Schematic - Traditional Model 1

The schematic shows the complete accumulation pattern with all five phases clearly labeled:
- **Phase A**: Stopping the downtrend (PS, SC, AR, ST)
- **Phase B**: Building the cause (consolidation)
- **Phase C**: The test (Spring)
- **Phase D**: The markup begins (SOS, LPS/BU)
- **Phase E**: The trend (Resistance becomes Support)

## Phase A: Stopping the Downtrend

**Purpose**: To halt the existing downtrend and establish the boundaries of the trading range.

### Key Events:
| Event | Description | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PS (Preliminary Support)** | First sign of buying interest | Early warning that selling pressure is weakening |
| **SC (Selling Climax)** | Panic selling with high volume | Marks the low of the range |
| **AR (Automatic Rally)** | First bounce after SC | Defines the upper boundary of the range |
| **ST (Secondary Test)** | Test of the SC low | Confirms demand is present |

### The "Black and White" Rule:
> Phase A is complete when the AR has formed. The range is now defined: SC low to AR high.

## Phase B: Building the Cause

**Purpose**: To build the "Cause" for the subsequent "Effect" (markup). This is where Smart Money accumulates their position.

### Key Characteristics:
- Price oscillates between the AR high and SC low.
- Multiple STs (Secondary Tests) may occur.
- This phase can last a **very long time**.
- Volume typically decreases as the phase progresses.

### The "Grand Secret" of Phase B:
> The longer Phase B lasts, the larger the subsequent markup will be. This is the **Law of Cause and Effect** in action.

## Phase C: The Test

**Purpose**: To "test" the remaining supply and trap retail traders before the markup.

### Key Events:
| Event | Description | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spring** | False breakdown below SC | Grabs liquidity, traps shorts |
| **Test** | Test of the Spring low | Confirms demand, low volume |

### The "Black and White" Rule:
> The Spring is the **lowest risk entry point** in the entire schematic. If the Test holds, the markup is imminent.

### Connection to Liquidity:
The Spring is a **liquidity grab**. It sweeps the stop losses of longs and triggers the entries of shorts. Smart Money uses this liquidity to fill their buy orders.

## Phase D: The Markup Begins

**Purpose**: To confirm the accumulation is complete and begin the markup phase.

### Key Events:
| Event | Description | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SOS (Sign of Strength)** | Strong move breaking AR high | Confirms bullish intent |
| **LPS (Last Point of Support)** | Pullback after SOS | Final entry opportunity |
| **BU (Back-Up)** | Test of the AR level as support | Confirms resistance is now support |

### The "Black and White" Rule:
> The SOS is a **BOS (Break of Structure)** in Market Structure terms. It confirms the new bullish trend.

## Phase E: The Trend

**Purpose**: To leave the accumulation range and trend toward the target.

### Key Characteristics:
- Price leaves the range and trends upward.
- The former AR (resistance) becomes support.
- Pullbacks should hold at the LPS or AR level.

### The "Grand Secret" of Phase E:
> The target of Phase E is determined by the size of the "Cause" (Phase B). Use the **Point and Figure** method or measure the range height to project targets.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Wyckoff Phases |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Structure** | Phase A = CHoCH, Phase D = BOS |
| **Supply and Demand** | SC = Demand Zone, AR = Supply Zone |
| **Liquidity** | Spring = Liquidity Grab |
| **Ranges** | Phase B = The Range, Phase C = Deviation |
| **Orderflow** | Phase A = Range, Phase C = Initiation, Phase D = Mitigation, Phase E = Continuation |

## The "Ultimate Interconnection"

> **The Wyckoff Phases are the "Roadmap" of Smart Money.**
> - Phase A tells you the range is forming.
> - Phase B tells you to wait.
> - Phase C tells you to prepare.
> - Phase D tells you to enter.
> - Phase E tells you to hold.

By understanding the phases, you can:
1. **Identify** where you are in the cycle.
2. **Anticipate** what comes next.
3. **Execute** with precision at the Spring or LPS.
