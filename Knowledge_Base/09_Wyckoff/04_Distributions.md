# Lesson 04: Distributions

This lesson (10:19) provides a **detailed breakdown of the Wyckoff distribution schematic**, which is the inverse of accumulation.

## Core Concept: Distribution Schematic

Distribution is the process by which **Smart Money sells** their positions to retail traders before a markdown (downtrend). It is the mirror image of accumulation.

## Visual Reference: Distribution Schematic - Traditional Model 1

The schematic shows the complete distribution pattern with all five phases:
- **Phase A**: Stopping the uptrend (PSY, BC, AR, ST)
- **Phase B**: Building the cause (consolidation)
- **Phase C**: The test (UTAD - Upthrust After Distribution)
- **Phase D**: The markdown begins (SOW, LPSY)
- **Phase E**: The trend (Support becomes Resistance)

## Key Distribution Events

| Event | Full Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PSY** | Preliminary Supply | First sign of selling interest after an uptrend |
| **BC** | Buying Climax | Panic buying that marks the high of the range |
| **AR** | Automatic Reaction | First drop after BC, defines the lower boundary |
| **ST** | Secondary Test | Test of the BC high |
| **SOW** | Sign of Weakness | Shows supply is overcoming demand |
| **LPSY** | Last Point of Supply | Final rally before markdown |
| **UT** | Upthrust | False breakout above range |
| **UTAD** | Upthrust After Distribution | False breakout that traps longs |
| **SOS** | Sign of Strength (in context) | Break below support confirming markdown |

## The Five Phases of Distribution

### Phase A: Stopping the Uptrend
- **PSY (Preliminary Supply)**: First sign of selling pressure.
- **BC (Buying Climax)**: Panic buying marks the high.
- **AR (Automatic Reaction)**: First drop defines the range low.
- **ST (Secondary Test)**: Test of the BC high.

### Phase B: Building the Cause
- Price oscillates between BC high and AR low.
- Smart Money is distributing (selling) during this phase.
- Multiple STs and UTs may occur.

### Phase C: The Test (UTAD)
- **UTAD (Upthrust After Distribution)**: False breakout above BC.
- This is the "trap" that catches retail buyers.
- Equivalent to the Spring in accumulation.

### Phase D: The Markdown Begins
- **SOW (Sign of Weakness)**: Strong move breaking AR low.
- **LPSY (Last Point of Supply)**: Final rally before markdown.
- This is where you want to enter your short position.

### Phase E: The Trend
- Price leaves the distribution range and trends downward.
- Former support (AR) becomes resistance.

## Distribution vs. Accumulation Comparison

| Accumulation | Distribution |
| :--- | :--- |
| PS (Preliminary Support) | PSY (Preliminary Supply) |
| SC (Selling Climax) | BC (Buying Climax) |
| AR (Automatic Rally) | AR (Automatic Reaction) |
| ST (Secondary Test) | ST (Secondary Test) |
| Spring | UTAD (Upthrust After Distribution) |
| SOS (Sign of Strength) | SOW (Sign of Weakness) |
| LPS (Last Point of Support) | LPSY (Last Point of Supply) |
| Markup | Markdown |

## The "Grand Secret" of Distribution

> **Distribution is the "Mirror Image" of Accumulation.**
> - Where accumulation has a Spring (false breakdown), distribution has a UTAD (false breakout).
> - Where accumulation has SOS (bullish), distribution has SOW (bearish).
> - The same rules apply, just inverted.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Distribution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Structure** | Phase A = CHoCH (bearish), Phase D = BOS (bearish) |
| **Supply and Demand** | BC = Supply Zone, AR = Demand Zone |
| **Liquidity** | UTAD = Liquidity Grab above the range |
| **Ranges** | Phase B = The Range, Phase C = Deviation (upward) |
| **Orderflow** | Phase A = Range, Phase C = Initiation, Phase D = Mitigation, Phase E = Continuation |

## Trading the Distribution

### Entry Points:
1. **UTAD**: Highest risk, highest reward. Enter short after the false breakout.
2. **LPSY**: Lower risk, good reward. Enter short on the final rally.
3. **SOW Retest**: Lowest risk, lower reward. Enter short after the SOW breaks support.

### Stop Loss:
- Above the UTAD high (for UTAD entry).
- Above the LPSY high (for LPSY entry).

### Take Profit:
- Based on the size of the "Cause" (Phase B).
- Use Point and Figure or range height projection.
