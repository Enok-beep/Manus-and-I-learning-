# Lesson 02: Accumulation Schematics 1/2 (Traditional)

This lesson (34:37) provides a **deep dive into the traditional Wyckoff accumulation schematics**.

## Core Concept: Accumulation Schematics

> "We're gonna talk about accumulation schematics. We are talking about the traditional model one schematic, as well as the model two accumulation schematic."

> "So there is going to be theory in this lesson, lots of it, lots of breeding, because I, I spent a lot of time writing things up for this very lesson."

> "So I won't be going with my mouse across this whole lesson here. I'm gonna be reading from my Microsoft Word where I have, uh, written things up that took me a very long time. I could not fit that on training view with my life..."

## The Two Accumulation Models

### Model 1: Accumulation with Spring
This is the "classic" Wyckoff accumulation pattern where price **breaks below** the range to grab liquidity before the markup phase.

### Model 2: Accumulation without Spring
This is a variation where price **does not break below** the range. Instead, it forms a "Last Point of Support" (LPS) and moves directly into the markup phase.

## The Phases of Accumulation

### Phase A: Stopping the Downtrend
- **PS (Preliminary Support)**: First sign of buying interest.
- **SC (Selling Climax)**: Panic selling that marks the low.
- **AR (Automatic Rally)**: The first bounce after the SC.
- **ST (Secondary Test)**: A test of the SC low.

### Phase B: Building the Cause
- Price oscillates between the AR high and SC low.
- Smart Money is accumulating (buying) during this phase.
- Multiple STs may occur.
- This phase can last a long time.

### Phase C: The Test (Spring or LPS)
- **Spring (Model 1)**: A false breakdown below the SC low to grab liquidity.
- **LPS (Model 2)**: A higher low that shows demand is absorbing supply.
- This is the "trap" that catches retail traders.

### Phase D: The Markup Begins
- **SOS (Sign of Strength)**: A strong move that breaks the AR high.
- **LPS (Last Point of Support)**: The final pullback before the markup.
- This is where you want to enter your long position.

### Phase E: The Trend
- Price leaves the accumulation range and trends upward.
- This is the "Effect" of the "Cause" (accumulation).

## Key Events in Accumulation

| Event | Description | What to Look For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PS** | Preliminary Support | First sign of buying after a downtrend. |
| **SC** | Selling Climax | High volume, wide spread, panic selling. |
| **AR** | Automatic Rally | First bounce, defines the range high. |
| **ST** | Secondary Test | Test of the SC low, should be on lower volume. |
| **Spring** | False Breakdown | Breaks below SC, quickly reverses. |
| **Test** | Test of Spring | Confirms the Spring, should be on low volume. |
| **SOS** | Sign of Strength | Breaks above AR, high volume, wide spread. |
| **LPS** | Last Point of Support | Final pullback before markup. |

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Accumulation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ranges** | The accumulation range is defined by the SC (low) and AR (high). |
| **Supply and Demand** | The SC is a Demand Zone. The AR is a Supply Zone. |
| **Liquidity** | The Spring is a liquidity grab below the SC. |
| **Market Structure** | The SOS is a BOS that confirms the new bullish trend. |
| **Orderflow** | The RIMC cycle maps directly to the Wyckoff phases. |

## The "Grand Secret" of Accumulation

> **Accumulation is the "Cause" of the uptrend.**
> - The longer the accumulation phase, the larger the subsequent markup.
> - The Spring is the "final trap" that gives Smart Money the best entry.
> - The SOS is the "confirmation" that the accumulation is complete.

By understanding accumulation, you can:
1. **Identify** where Smart Money is buying.
2. **Enter** at the Spring or LPS for the best Risk/Reward.
3. **Target** the "Effect" (markup) based on the size of the "Cause."
