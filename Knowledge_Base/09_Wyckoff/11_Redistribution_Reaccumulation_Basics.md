# Lesson 11: Redistribution/Reaccumulation Basics

This lesson (11:45) introduces the **continuation patterns** of Wyckoff—Redistribution and Reaccumulation.

## Core Concept: Continuation Patterns

> "All right. So we know that with a standard accumulation model, the general consensus is that you need to have the swing low pulled for a move up to the high, right? You need to have your range low, pulling it up towards that swing high. So a K a prices pulling in a downwards direction. That's your typical accumulation model with the reac cumulation model. It can happen in an uptrending environment, even if you pull from high to low where it almost looks like it should be a..."

## Reaccumulation vs. Accumulation

| Feature | Accumulation | Reaccumulation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Context** | Downtrend (Reversal) | Uptrend (Continuation) |
| **Purpose** | Start a new uptrend | Continue an existing uptrend |
| **Location** | At market lows | In the middle of an uptrend |
| **Result** | Markup begins | Markup continues |

## Redistribution vs. Distribution

| Feature | Distribution | Redistribution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Context** | Uptrend (Reversal) | Downtrend (Continuation) |
| **Purpose** | Start a new downtrend | Continue an existing downtrend |
| **Location** | At market highs | In the middle of a downtrend |
| **Result** | Markdown begins | Markdown continues |

## How to Identify Reaccumulation

### Key Characteristics:
1. **Uptrend Context**: Price is already in an established uptrend.
2. **Pullback Range**: Price consolidates, creating a range.
3. **Spring/Test**: Price may sweep the range low (liquidity grab).
4. **Continuation**: Price breaks out to the upside and continues the uptrend.

### The "Black and White" Rule:
> **If the range forms in an uptrend and breaks up, it's Reaccumulation.**
> **If the range forms in an uptrend and breaks down, it was Distribution.**

## How to Identify Redistribution

### Key Characteristics:
1. **Downtrend Context**: Price is already in an established downtrend.
2. **Rally Range**: Price consolidates, creating a range.
3. **UTAD/Test**: Price may sweep the range high (liquidity grab).
4. **Continuation**: Price breaks out to the downside and continues the downtrend.

### The "Black and White" Rule:
> **If the range forms in a downtrend and breaks down, it's Redistribution.**
> **If the range forms in a downtrend and breaks up, it was Accumulation.**

## Trading Reaccumulation

### Entry Points:
1. **Spring Entry**: Enter long at the spring (sweep of range low).
2. **LPS Entry**: Enter long on the pullback after the SOS.
3. **BOS Retest Entry**: Enter long after the BOS retests the range high as support.

### Stop Loss Placement:
- Below the Spring low.
- Below the LPS low.
- Below the range high (for BOS retest entry).

## Trading Redistribution

### Entry Points:
1. **UTAD Entry**: Enter short at the UTAD (sweep of range high).
2. **LPSY Entry**: Enter short on the pullback after the SOW.
3. **BOS Retest Entry**: Enter short after the BOS retests the range low as resistance.

### Stop Loss Placement:
- Above the UTAD high.
- Above the LPSY high.
- Above the range low (for BOS retest entry).

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Re-patterns |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Structure** | Reaccumulation = HL in uptrend; Redistribution = LH in downtrend |
| **Supply and Demand** | Continuation zones (RBR/DBD) |
| **Liquidity** | Liquidity grabs within the trend |
| **Ranges** | Ranges within trends |
| **Orderflow** | RIMC cycle continues |

## The "Grand Secret" of Continuation Patterns

> **Reaccumulation and Redistribution are the "Staircasing" of Wyckoff.**
> - They are the **building blocks** of a sustained trend.
> - Every major trend is made up of multiple Re-patterns.
> - Understanding this allows you to **add to winning positions** safely.

## The "Ultimate Interconnection"

> **Continuation patterns connect Wyckoff to Market Structure.**
> - A **Higher Low** in an uptrend is often a **Reaccumulation**.
> - A **Lower High** in a downtrend is often a **Redistribution**.
> - This is the **solution** to the complexity of "is this a reversal or a pullback."
