# Lesson 09: Distribution Model 2

This lesson (24:00) provides a **detailed breakdown of Distribution Model 2**, the inverse of Accumulation Model 2.

## Core Concept: Distribution Model 2

> "So we're gonna look at a distribution schematic model two. Okay? So just like an accumulation schematic model two except upside down, there really isn't much of a difference except for that obviously instead of demand, you're gonna be using supply for the third tap, right?"

## Key Difference: Model 1 vs. Model 2 Distribution

| Feature | Distribution Model 1 | Distribution Model 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Last Leg** | Higher High (UTAD) | Lower High (No UTAD) |
| **Trap** | Yes (Liquidity Grab) | No (Direct Breakdown) |
| **Entry Timing** | Earlier (UTAD) | Later (SOW) |
| **Risk/Reward** | Higher | Lower |

## Model 2 Distribution Structure

### The Key Characteristic
- The final test before the markdown is a **Lower High** instead of a UTAD.
- There is **no false breakout** above the range.
- Price simply consolidates and breaks down.

## The "Black and White" Rules for Distribution Model 2

### Identification:
1. **Uptrend Context**: Price must be coming from a bullish environment.
2. **Range Formation**: Clear consolidation with defined high and low.
3. **Lower High**: The final test is a Lower High, not a UTAD.
4. **BOS**: Break of structure below the range low.

### Entry Points:
1. **Lower High Entry**: Enter short at the Lower High (requires LTF confirmation).
2. **LPSY Entry**: Enter short on the pullback after the SOW.
3. **BOS Retest Entry**: Enter short after the BOS retests the range low as resistance.

## The "Grand Secret" of Distribution Model 2

> **Distribution Model 2 is the "Weakness" pattern.**
> - No UTAD means **supply is too strong** to allow a breakout.
> - The Lower High is a **sign of weakness**, not strength.
