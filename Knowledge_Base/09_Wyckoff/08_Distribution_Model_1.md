# Lesson 08: Distribution Model 1

This lesson (24:42) provides a **detailed breakdown of Distribution Model 1**, the inverse of Accumulation Model 1.

## Core Concept: Distribution Model 1

> "All right, we're gonna talk about a model one distribution. So similar to the accumulation model one except upside down. We're looking for this three drive motion where we have three higher highs in a row, generally with a model one. Again, as with the accumulation model one, you're looking for a lack of structural change between here and here for starters. Slash not being able to really get a whole lot of follow through on this second tap you, that volume usually dies off on the..."

## Key Characteristics of Model 1 Distribution

### Context Requirement
- Distribution **always** occurs after an uptrend.
- The uptrend can be on any timeframe (local, internal, swing, fractal).
- The key is that price is coming from a **bullish environment**.

### The Three Drive Motion
- **Three Higher Highs** in a row.
- Each high shows **diminishing momentum**.
- Volume typically **dies off** on the second and third taps.

### The Model 1 Distribution Structure

| Phase | Event | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase A** | PSY, BC, AR, ST | Stopping the uptrend |
| **Phase B** | Consolidation | Building the cause |
| **Phase C** | UTAD (Upthrust After Distribution) | False breakout (liquidity grab) |
| **Phase D** | SOW, LPSY | Confirmation of distribution |
| **Phase E** | Markdown | The downtrend begins |

## Key Events Explained

### PSY (Preliminary Supply)
- First sign that supply is entering the market.
- Price starts to struggle to make new highs.

### BC (Buying Climax)
- The final push higher.
- Often accompanied by high volume.
- Smart Money is selling into retail buying.

### AR (Automatic Reaction)
- The first significant drop.
- Defines the bottom of the range.

### ST (Secondary Test)
- Test of the BC high.
- Usually on lower volume.

### UTAD (Upthrust After Distribution)
- **The Trap** - False breakout above the range.
- Grabs liquidity from breakout traders.
- The inverse of the Spring in accumulation.

### SOW (Sign of Weakness)
- Break of structure below the range.
- Confirms the distribution is complete.

### LPSY (Last Point of Supply)
- Pullback after the SOW.
- Entry point for shorts.

## The "Black and White" Rules for Distribution Model 1

### Identification:
1. **Uptrend Context**: Price must be coming from a bullish environment.
2. **Range Formation**: Clear consolidation with defined high and low.
3. **UTAD**: False breakout above the range high.
4. **Reclaim**: Price quickly reclaims the range.
5. **BOS**: Break of structure below the range low.

### Entry Points:
1. **UTAD Entry**: Enter short immediately after the UTAD (highest risk, highest reward).
2. **LPSY Entry**: Enter short on the pullback after the SOW (lower risk, good reward).
3. **BOS Retest Entry**: Enter short after the BOS retests the range low as resistance (lowest risk).

### Stop Loss Placement:
- Above the UTAD high (for UTAD entry).
- Above the LPSY high (for LPSY entry).
- Above the range low (for BOS retest entry).

### Take Profit Targets:
1. **TP1**: The range low (if entering at UTAD).
2. **TP2**: The next HTF structural level.
3. **TP3**: Based on the size of the "Cause" (range).

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Distribution Model 1 |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Structure** | Uptrend → Range → BOS → Downtrend |
| **Supply and Demand** | BC = Supply Zone, AR = Demand Zone |
| **Liquidity** | UTAD = Liquidity Grab (SSL sweep) |
| **Ranges** | Phase B = Premium/Discount zones apply |
| **Orderflow** | Range → Initiation (UTAD) → Mitigation (LPSY) → Continuation (Markdown) |

## The "Grand Secret" of Distribution Model 1

> **Distribution Model 1 is the "Trap and Flip" pattern for shorts.**
> - The UTAD **traps** retail longs.
> - The SOW **flips** the structure to bearish.
> - The LPSY **confirms** the new downtrend.

## Accumulation vs. Distribution Comparison

| Feature | Accumulation Model 1 | Distribution Model 1 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Context** | Downtrend | Uptrend |
| **Trap** | Spring (Below Range) | UTAD (Above Range) |
| **Confirmation** | SOS (Break Above) | SOW (Break Below) |
| **Entry** | LPS (Higher Low) | LPSY (Lower High) |
| **Direction** | Long | Short |

## The "Ultimate Interconnection"

> **Distribution Model 1 is the mirror image of Accumulation Model 1.**
> - Everything you learned about accumulation applies in reverse.
> - The UTAD is the "Spring" for shorts.
> - The LPSY is the "LPS" for shorts.

This symmetry is the **foundation** of understanding market cycles.
