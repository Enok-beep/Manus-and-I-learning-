# Lesson 03: Liquidity Curves

This lesson (18:57) introduces Jayson Casper's **"Famous Liquidity Curve"** tool—a visual method for mapping where liquidity is building in the market.

## Introduction to Liquidity Structure

> "Now that we have a better understanding as to what exactly buy side and sell side liquidity is, we can now look at a liquidity structure."

### The Goal:
- Move from **identifying** liquidity to **visualizing** it.
- Use **curves** to map the "path of least resistance."

## The "Famous Liquidity Curve"

> "This is my famous liquidity curve. You may have seen this in multiple streams of mine. It's not really something that I've held privately per se, but I haven't really went over all of my rules and justification on using this liquidity curve tool. For those that are not aware..."

### Key Insight:
- The Liquidity Curve is a **visual tool** that shows where liquidity is accumulating.
- It's not just a trendline—it's a **map of stop losses**.

## How to Access the Tool

> "You can find the curve tool under the brush icon and you can favorite this in your favorite spa very easily by clicking this favorite button. Okay?"

### TradingView Setup:
1. Find the **Brush Icon** in TradingView.
2. Select the **Curve Tool**.
3. **Favorite** it for quick access.

## The Two Types of Liquidity Curves

### Sell Side Liquidity Curve (SSC):
- Drawn along the **lows** of a bullish trend.
- Represents where **long stop losses** are accumulating.
- Price often "sweeps" this curve before continuing higher.

### Buy Side Liquidity Curve (BSC):
- Drawn along the **highs** of a bearish trend.
- Represents where **short stop losses** are accumulating.
- Price often "sweeps" this curve before continuing lower.

## The "Grand Secret" of Liquidity Curves

The "grand secret" is that **Liquidity Curves are Dynamic Targets**.
- Unlike static support/resistance levels, curves **move with the market**.
- They show you where liquidity is **building over time**.
- Smart Money will often "tap" the curve to grab liquidity before reversing.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Liquidity Curves |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Structure** | The curve follows the structural lows (bullish) or highs (bearish). |
| **Supply and Demand** | The curve often aligns with S&D zones. |
| **Trendlines** | Liquidity curves are a more sophisticated version of trendlines. |

## Practical Application

### Drawing a Sell Side Liquidity Curve:
1. Identify a **bullish trend** with clear Higher Lows.
2. Use the **Curve Tool** to connect the lows.
3. The curve represents where **long stop losses** are resting.
4. Watch for price to **sweep** the curve before continuing higher.

### Drawing a Buy Side Liquidity Curve:
1. Identify a **bearish trend** with clear Lower Highs.
2. Use the **Curve Tool** to connect the highs.
3. The curve represents where **short stop losses** are resting.
4. Watch for price to **sweep** the curve before continuing lower.

## The "Black and White" Rule

> **The curve is a target, not a stop loss level.**

- Don't place your stop **at** the curve.
- Place your stop **behind** the curve (with some buffer).
- Use the curve to **anticipate** where price will go, not to define your risk.
