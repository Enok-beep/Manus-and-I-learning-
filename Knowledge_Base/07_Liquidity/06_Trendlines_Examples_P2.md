# Lesson 06: Trendlines / Examples Part 2

This lesson (06:29) continues the practical examples of **trendline liquidity**, focusing on **higher timeframe** analysis and the importance of **multi-timeframe confluence**.

## Introduction to Higher Timeframe Trendlines

> "So as you can see, these trend lines are present everywhere. So even across higher timeframes. Let's go to the one hour timeframe and take a look."

### The Goal:
- Extend the trendline liquidity concept to **higher timeframes**.
- Show that the same principles apply across all timeframes.

## Multi-Timeframe Trendline Analysis

> "We'll take a look and see if there are any more obvious higher timeframe trend lines. Well, let's take a look right here. So between point A and point B."

### Key Insight:
- Trendlines on **higher timeframes** are more significant.
- They represent **larger pools of liquidity**.
- A sweep of an HTF trendline is a **major event**.

## The "Three Points" Rule

> "...this would've been a trend line at first, and actually it almost had three points to the trend line. However, structure did not change. We haven't taken a..."

### Key Insight:
- A valid trendline needs **at least two points**.
- **Three points** make the trendline more significant.
- More points = more liquidity accumulating along the line.

## The "Structure Did Not Change" Rule

> "...structure did not change. We haven't taken a..."

### Key Insight:
- A trendline sweep is only significant if **structure changes**.
- If price sweeps the trendline but structure remains intact, the trend continues.
- This connects back to **Market Structure** (Chapter 3): always wait for the **BOS** or **CHoCH**.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to HTF Trendlines |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Structure** | HTF trendlines align with HTF structural points. |
| **Advanced MS** | The "Overlapping Structure Pulls" concept applies to trendlines. |
| **Bias Determination** | HTF trendline direction confirms the overall bias. |

## The "Grand Secret" of HTF Trendlines

The "grand secret" is that **HTF Trendlines are the "Big Picture" Liquidity Map**.
- LTF trendlines are for **entries**.
- HTF trendlines are for **bias**.
- If the HTF trendline is bullish, you should be looking for **longs** on the LTF.

## Practical Application

### The "HTF to LTF" Workflow:
1. Identify the **HTF trendline** (1H, 4H, Daily).
2. Determine the **bias** based on the HTF trendline direction.
3. Drop to the **LTF** (5m, 15m) to find entries.
4. Look for **LTF trendline sweeps** that align with the HTF bias.
5. Enter after the sweep, with your stop behind the LTF structure.

### The "Confluence" Advantage:
- When an LTF trendline sweep aligns with an HTF S&D zone, you have **confluence**.
- Confluence = Higher probability trade.
