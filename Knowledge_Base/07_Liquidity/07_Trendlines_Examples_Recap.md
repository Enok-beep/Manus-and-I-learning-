# Lesson 07: Trendlines / Examples Recap

This lesson (08:10) provides a **summary** of the entire Liquidity chapter, consolidating the key rules for using trendlines and liquidity in trading.

## The Recap Summary

> "So again, as a little recap, you are looking for a trend line that presents itself in a very obvious fashion containing at least two points. Ideally, Wix much, much more ideal to have a wick here, wick here, and a wick here, right?"

### The "Black and White" Rules:
1. **Obvious Trendline**: The trendline should be clear and visible.
2. **At Least Two Points**: Minimum requirement for a valid trendline.
3. **Wicks Preferred**: Wicks touching the trendline are more significant than bodies.

## The "Close Below" Rule

> "You have that all is fine, all is well, and then what you're looking for is a close below the trend line."

### Key Insight:
- A **wick** below the trendline is not enough.
- You need a **body close** below the trendline to confirm the sweep.
- This connects back to **Market Structure** (Chapter 3): the "Body vs. Wick" rule.

## The "Structure Change" Confirmation

> "Once you get a close below that trend line, you're watching for a structure change, right? Once you get that structure change in your favor..."

### Key Insight:
- The sweep is only **Step 1**.
- **Step 2** is waiting for a **structure change** (BOS or CHoCH).
- The structure change confirms that Smart Money has finished grabbing liquidity.

## The Complete Trendline Liquidity Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Identify** an obvious trendline with at least two points.
2. **Wait** for price to approach the trendline.
3. **Confirm** a body close beyond the trendline (the sweep).
4. **Watch** for a structure change in your favor.
5. **Enter** after the structure change.
6. **Place Stop** behind the structure that caused the change.
7. **Target** the next liquidity pool (opposite side of the range).

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Trendline Recap |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Structure** | The "Body Close" and "Structure Change" rules. |
| **Supply and Demand** | The entry often aligns with an S&D zone. |
| **Orderflow** | The sweep is the "Mitigation" phase of RIMC. |
| **Risk Management** | Stop placement behind the structure. |

## The "Ultimate Interconnection" for Liquidity

The "grand secret" of the entire Liquidity chapter is:

> **Liquidity is the "Why" behind price movement.**

| Chapter | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Management** | Defines *how much* you can lose. |
| **Market Structure** | Defines *which direction* you should trade. |
| **Supply and Demand** | Defines *where* you should enter. |
| **Orderflow** | Defines *when* to enter (RIMC cycle). |
| **Advanced MS** | Defines *how* to use multiple timeframes. |
| **Liquidity** | Defines *why* price moves to certain levels. |

## The "Black and White" Checklist

Before entering a trade based on trendline liquidity:
- [ ] Is the trendline obvious and well-defined?
- [ ] Does the trendline have at least two points (ideally three)?
- [ ] Has price closed beyond the trendline (sweep)?
- [ ] Has structure changed in your favor?
- [ ] Is your stop behind the structure that caused the change?
- [ ] Is your target at the next liquidity pool?
