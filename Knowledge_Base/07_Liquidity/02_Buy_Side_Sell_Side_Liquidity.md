# Lesson 02: Buy Side/Sell Side Liquidity

This lesson (04:51) explains the two fundamental types of liquidity: **Buy Side Liquidity (BSL)** and **Sell Side Liquidity (SSL)**.

## The Two Types of Liquidity

### Buy Side Liquidity (BSL):
- **Location**: Above swing highs and resistance levels.
- **Composition**: Stop losses of short sellers + Buy stop orders from breakout traders.
- **What happens when hit**: Price spikes up to "grab" this liquidity, then often reverses.

### Sell Side Liquidity (SSL):
- **Location**: Below swing lows and support levels.
- **Composition**: Stop losses of long buyers + Sell stop orders from breakdown traders.
- **What happens when hit**: Price spikes down to "grab" this liquidity, then often reverses.

## Visual Representation

The video shows a chart with:
- **BSL** marked above the highs (where shorts have their stops).
- **SSL** marked below the lows (where longs have their stops).
- Price moving in a wave pattern, grabbing liquidity on both sides.

## The "Grand Secret" of BSL/SSL

The "grand secret" is that **Smart Money needs liquidity to enter and exit positions**.
- To **buy** a large position, Smart Money needs **sellers**. They find sellers at SSL (where longs are stopped out).
- To **sell** a large position, Smart Money needs **buyers**. They find buyers at BSL (where shorts are stopped out).

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to BSL/SSL |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Structure** | Swing highs are BSL pools; Swing lows are SSL pools. |
| **Supply and Demand** | S&D zones are often located near liquidity pools. |
| **Protected vs. Targeted** | A "Targeted" high is a BSL pool; a "Targeted" low is an SSL pool. |

## Practical Application

### The "Liquidity Grab" Pattern:
1. Price approaches a swing high (BSL).
2. Price **breaks** the high, triggering buy stops.
3. Smart Money **sells** into this liquidity.
4. Price **reverses** and drops.

### The Inverse:
1. Price approaches a swing low (SSL).
2. Price **breaks** the low, triggering sell stops.
3. Smart Money **buys** into this liquidity.
4. Price **reverses** and rises.

## The "Black and White" Rule

> **Never place your stop loss at an obvious liquidity pool.**

- If your stop is at the same level as everyone else's, you will be stopped out.
- Place your stop **behind** the liquidity pool, not **at** it.
