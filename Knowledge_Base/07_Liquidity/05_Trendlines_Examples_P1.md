# Lesson 05: Trendlines / Examples Part 1

This lesson (28:36) provides a deep dive into **trendline liquidity** with real chart examples, showing how to use trendlines as liquidity maps rather than traditional support/resistance.

## Introduction to Trendline Liquidity

> "All right guys. So today we're gonna talk a little bit about using trendline liquidity to form a overall local objective, uh, liquidity based target."

### The Goal:
- Use trendlines to identify **liquidity targets**.
- Shift from a "support/resistance" mindset to a "liquidity" mindset.

## The Jayson Casper Approach

> "...if you will, how we can employ that to our advantage. To begin. As an experienced day trader myself, I do employ this trading strategy that I um, developed quite a while ago incorporating the use of candlestick patterns that utilize trend lines from a liquidity based perspective rather than a support and resistance perspective like the traditional approach. My personal approach..."

### Key Insight:
- Traditional traders see trendlines as **support/resistance**.
- Smart Money traders see trendlines as **liquidity pools**.
- The difference is in **intent**: support is where price "bounces"; liquidity is where price "grabs" before moving.

## The "Liquidity Perspective" vs. "Traditional Perspective"

| Traditional Approach | Liquidity Approach |
| :--- | :--- |
| Trendline = Support/Resistance | Trendline = Liquidity Pool |
| Price bounces off the line | Price sweeps the line, then reverses |
| Entry at the line | Entry after the sweep |
| Stop loss at the line | Stop loss behind the line |

## The "Grand Secret" of Trendline Liquidity

The "grand secret" is that **Trendlines are Magnets, Not Barriers**.
- Price is **attracted** to trendlines because that's where stop losses are clustered.
- Once the stops are hit, Smart Money has the liquidity to move price in the opposite direction.
- This is why "trendline breaks" often lead to **reversals**, not continuations.

## Practical Application

### Drawing Trendlines for Liquidity:
1. Identify a clear **trend** (bullish or bearish).
2. Connect the **structural lows** (bullish) or **structural highs** (bearish).
3. The trendline represents where **stop losses are accumulating**.
4. Wait for price to **sweep** the trendline.
5. Enter in the **opposite direction** after the sweep.

### The "Sweep and Reverse" Pattern:
1. Price approaches the trendline.
2. Price **breaks** the trendline (triggering stops).
3. Price **reverses** and moves in the opposite direction.
4. This is your **entry signal**.

| Concept | Connection to Trendline Liquidity |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Structure** | Trendlines connect structural points (HH/HL or LH/LL). |
| **Supply and Demand** | The sweep often leads to an S&D zone. |
| **Liquidity Curves** | Trendlines are a simplified version of liquidity curves. |

## Example Analysis

The video walks through multiple chart examples showing:
1. How to identify trendline liquidity.
2. How to wait for the sweep.
3. How to enter after the sweep.
4. How to manage the trade using Risk Management principles.

### Key Takeaway:
- **Patience** is critical. Don't enter at the trendline; wait for the sweep.
- The sweep is your **confirmation** that Smart Money has grabbed the liquidity.
