# Lesson 04: Trading Liquidity

This lesson (10:16) explains how to **trade** using liquidity concepts—specifically, how to use trendlines and liquidity curves to identify high-probability entry points.

## Introduction to Trading Liquidity

> "Hey guys. We're gonna talk about using trend lines of liquidity and liquidity as a whole to identify whether or not a supplier demand zone looks like a more effective zone."

### The Goal:
- Use liquidity to **validate** S&D zones.
- Identify which zones are **more effective** for entries.

## The "Sweep Before Entry" Tactic

> "So this is a very commonly used tactic by myself. I do enjoy a nice liquidity curve or trend line, for example, to be swept or engineered prior to hitting my order block. And a lot of the time if I get that criteria, depending on the reaction..."

### Key Insight:
- A **sweep** of liquidity before hitting your S&D zone is a **confirmation** signal.
- It shows that Smart Money has grabbed the fuel they need to move price.

## The "No Structural Change" Rule

> "...even if there is no structural change coming into the block itself, as long as it makes sense to do..."

### Key Insight:
- You don't always need a **CHoCH** or **BOS** to enter.
- If liquidity has been swept and price is at a valid S&D zone, the entry can be valid.
- This is a more **aggressive** entry style.

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Trading Liquidity |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Supply and Demand** | Liquidity sweeps **validate** S&D zones. |
| **Orderflow** | The sweep is part of the **Mitigation** phase of RIMC. |
| **Market Structure** | The sweep often creates a **Swing Failure Pattern (SFP)**. |

## The "Grand Secret" of Trading Liquidity

The "grand secret" is that **Liquidity Sweeps are the "Green Light" for entries**.
- A zone without a sweep is a **maybe**.
- A zone with a sweep is a **high-probability** entry.
- The sweep shows that Smart Money has **loaded up** and is ready to move.

## Practical Application

### The "Sweep + Zone" Entry:
1. Identify a valid **S&D zone** (using criteria from Chapter 4).
2. Draw a **Liquidity Curve** along the structural points leading to the zone.
3. Wait for price to **sweep** the curve (grab the liquidity).
4. Enter at the **S&D zone** after the sweep.
5. Place your stop **behind** the zone (not at the curve).

### The Risk/Reward Advantage:
- By waiting for the sweep, you get a **tighter stop loss**.
- The sweep often marks the **exact low/high** of the move.
- This allows for much higher **Risk/Reward ratios**.

## The "Black and White" Rule

> **A liquidity sweep before your entry zone is a confirmation, not a requirement.**

- If you see a sweep, your confidence in the zone increases.
- If you don't see a sweep, the zone can still be valid, but you should be more cautious.
- Always use **Risk Management** (Chapter 2) to protect yourself.
