# Lesson 05: Finding Range Trades

This lesson (24:21) teaches how to **find and execute trades within ranges** using Supply and Demand and Premium/Discount pricing.

## Core Concept: Combining Ranges with S&D

> "Now we're gonna talk about using supply and demand and using the scale extreme premium and extreme discount to actually find trades."

### Key Insight:
> "How can we employ that? Is there any way to use supply and demand within the extreme zones of the ranges that we're drawing to get a better edge on price action?"

## The Step-by-Step Process

> "Well, let's see. Let's go ahead and start to identify a range."

### Step 1: Identify the Range
> "If we are presented with an idea, so clearly you had a range here. This was a swing low and a swing high."

- Mark the **Swing High** (Range High).
- Mark the **Swing Low** (Range Low).
- Ensure the range is **Significant** (from Lesson 04).

### Step 2: Apply Fibonacci Retracement
- Draw Fibonacci from the **Range Low** to the **Range High**.
- Identify the **50% level** (Equilibrium).
- Mark the **Premium Zone** (above 50%) and **Discount Zone** (below 50%).

### Step 3: Identify S&D Zones at Extremes
- Look for **Demand Zones** in the **Discount Zone** (for longs).
- Look for **Supply Zones** in the **Premium Zone** (for shorts).
- Prioritize zones that caused a **BOS** or **CHoCH**.

### Step 4: Wait for Price to Enter the Zone
- Be patient. Let price come to your POI.
- Do not chase price in the middle of the range.

### Step 5: Look for Entry Confirmation
- Wait for a **LTF structural shift** (CHoCH or BOS).
- Look for **Orderflow confirmation** (RIMC cycle).
- Enter on the **Mitigation** of the S&D zone.

### Step 6: Set Stop Loss and Targets
- **Stop Loss**: Beyond the S&D zone (and beyond the range extreme if possible).
- **Target 1**: The 50% level (Equilibrium).
- **Target 2**: The opposite side of the range.
- **Target 3**: Beyond the range (if structure supports it).

## The "Black and White" Rule for Range Trades

> **The best range trades are:**
> 1. In a **Significant** range.
> 2. At an **Extreme** (Premium or Discount zone).
> 3. At a **Valid S&D zone** (one that caused a BOS).
> 4. With **LTF confirmation** (CHoCH or BOS).

## Practical Application: The "Extreme Zone" Strategy

| Scenario | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| Price enters **Discount Zone** in a bullish range | Look for **Demand Zones** to go long. |
| Price enters **Premium Zone** in a bearish range | Look for **Supply Zones** to go short. |
| Price is in the **Middle Zone** (around 50%) | Wait. Do not trade. |

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Finding Range Trades |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Structure** | The range is defined by HTF structural points. |
| **Supply and Demand** | S&D zones at range extremes are the entry points. |
| **Liquidity** | Range extremes are liquidity pools. |
| **Orderflow** | The RIMC cycle provides entry confirmation. |
| **Premium/Discount** | Defines where to look for entries (extremes). |

## The "Grand Secret" of Finding Range Trades

The "grand secret" is that **Range Trades are the highest probability setups in trading.**
- You know the **boundaries** (Range High and Low).
- You know the **direction** (from the HTF bias).
- You know the **entry zone** (S&D at the extreme).
- You know the **target** (the opposite side of the range).

By combining all of these elements, you create a trade with:
- **Defined Risk** (stop beyond the extreme).
- **High Probability** (trading from a confluence zone).
- **Excellent Risk/Reward** (targeting the opposite side).

## The "Confluence Checklist" for Range Trades

Before entering a range trade, check for:
- [ ] **Significant Range** (HTF structural alignment).
- [ ] **Extreme Zone** (Premium or Discount).
- [ ] **Valid S&D Zone** (caused a BOS).
- [ ] **LTF Confirmation** (CHoCH or BOS).
- [ ] **Liquidity Sweep** (optional, but adds probability).
