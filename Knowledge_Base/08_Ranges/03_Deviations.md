# Lesson 03: Deviations

This lesson (10:26) introduces the concept of **Deviations** within ranges, which is a critical pattern for identifying high-probability trade setups.

## Core Concept: What is a Deviation?

> "So now we're gonna talk about how ranges deviate, and again, this boils down to the liquidity video that I indicated earlier with buy and sell stops, and that would be in the liquidity section of my course."

### Definition:
A **Deviation** occurs when price temporarily breaks out of a range, grabs liquidity, and then returns back inside the range.

### Key Insight:
> "I would highly suggest that you guys watch that part before watching this part because that's very, very smart. Otherwise, it's not gonna make a whole lot of sense as to why this works."

## Connection to Liquidity

> "I would also suggest that you watch my theory on weak highs, weak lows, and you understand..."

### The Liquidity Connection:
- **Range Highs** = Buy-side liquidity (stop losses of shorts).
- **Range Lows** = Sell-side liquidity (stop losses of longs).
- **Deviations** = The market "grabbing" this liquidity before reversing.

## The "False Breakout" Pattern

A **Deviation** is essentially a **False Breakout**:
1. Price breaks above/below the range boundary.
2. Retail traders enter in the direction of the breakout.
3. Smart Money uses this liquidity to fill their orders in the opposite direction.
4. Price reverses back into the range.

## Types of Deviations

| Type | Description | Trading Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bullish Deviation** | Price breaks below the range low, grabs sell-side liquidity, and reverses up. | Look for long entries after the deviation. |
| **Bearish Deviation** | Price breaks above the range high, grabs buy-side liquidity, and reverses down. | Look for short entries after the deviation. |

## The "Black and White" Rule for Deviations

> **A valid deviation must:**
> 1. Break the range boundary (high or low).
> 2. Grab liquidity (sweep the stops).
> 3. Close back inside the range (body close, not just wick).
> 4. Show a structural shift on the LTF (CHoCH or BOS).

## Practical Application

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. Identify a **Range** (from Lesson 01).
2. Mark the **Range High** and **Range Low**.
3. Wait for price to **break** one of the boundaries.
4. Look for a **rejection** (wick or immediate reversal).
5. Confirm with a **LTF structural shift** (CHoCH).
6. Enter in the direction of the reversal.
7. Place stop loss **beyond the deviation wick**.
8. Target the **opposite side of the range** (or beyond).

## Connection to Previous Chapters

| Concept | Connection to Deviations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Structure** | The LTF CHoCH after a deviation is your entry signal. |
| **Supply and Demand** | The deviation often creates a new S&D zone at the extreme. |
| **Liquidity** | Deviations are liquidity grabs—the market is hunting stops. |
| **Orderflow** | The deviation is the "Initiation" phase of the RIMC cycle. |

## The "Grand Secret" of Deviations

The "grand secret" is that **Deviations are the "Trap" that Smart Money sets for Retail.**
- Retail traders see a "breakout" and enter.
- Smart Money uses their orders to fill their own positions.
- The market reverses, and Retail is trapped.
- By waiting for the deviation to complete, you are trading *with* Smart Money, not against them.

## The "Phoenix Deviation Technique" (Preview)

This lesson is the foundation for the **Phoenix Deviation Technique** strategy, which will be covered in the Strategies chapter. The key is to:
1. Identify a range.
2. Wait for a deviation.
3. Enter on the reversal.
4. Target the opposite side of the range (and beyond).
